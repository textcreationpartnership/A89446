            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough learned Pens in moſt countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> have travelled ſucceſsfully theſe many years, in diſcovering the impoſtures of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo as it might ſeem ſufficient to let the world enjoy the tractates al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready extant on that ſubject; Yet the ſedulity of the miniſters of that Church, in propoſing Sophiſms, often, and long ago confuted, in a new dreſs, as if they were new topicks, yea unheard of demonſtrations, thereby to enſnare unwary Readers, doth impoſe a neceſſity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſincere Lovers of Truth, for undeceiving the ſimple, to reſume old Grounds from Scripture, Antiquity, and reaſon formerly improved by our renouned <hi>Heroe's.</hi> This had the ſtronger influence upon me to write theſe curſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry animadverſions upon a Popiſh Pamphlet, otherwiſe of ſmall ſignificancy; becauſe ſome through a lazy humour, will not, others being immerſed in worldly entanglements, hardly can peruſe the large volumns of <hi>Chamier, Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, Calvin, Zanchius, Jewel, Uſher, Junius, Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius, Gerard</hi> and other Champions for the Truth;
<pb facs="tcp:150121:3"/>
yea ſome are ſmitten with ſuch a fancy of Novelty, tha nothing doth reliſh with them, unleſs it come ſmoaking from the Preſs.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not deny, but I was likewiſe moved with a juſt indignation, againſt the diſputing party among Romaniſts, many of whom, being by aſſed with inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, ſeem to violent their own conſciences in obtrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſtures on the World. Can it be ſuppoſed, that men of ſuch raiſed parts, and eminent learning, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſenſible from their own failours, of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes attending humane intellects, ſhould believe the infallibility of the Papal chair in Dogmatical deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeeing thoſe who often ſit therein are known, neither to be men of greateſt learning and Piety, nor ever did God ſince the foundation of the World, entail infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon an elective ſucceſſion of perſons, chiefly when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſts, and intrigues of Policy have the chief ſtroke in the election? Can they believe an univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy over all Princes and Churches to be ſetled by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine denation on the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeeing Scripture hath no veſtige of that fifth Monarchy, unleſs it be in the Apocalyptick predictions, and the Fathers of the ancient Church have not ſpared to contradict the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> in their Dogmatical definitions? Can they believe the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Image-worſhip, (whatever Metaphyſical diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they have coyned to put a fair gloſs on the matter) it being ſo expreſly prohibited in the decalogue, and no pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice there of occurring in the Chatholick Church, for three Ages and upwards after Chriſt, whereof thoſe great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguaries cannot be igno ant? Can theſe great maſters of reaſon, believe the prodigius figment of tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may vye with any of the Fables of <hi>Apuleius, Ovid,</hi> or <hi>Aeſop,</hi> and is ſo lueulently repugnant to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe and reaſon of all mankind, that a great man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, going to Maſs, is reported to have been
<pb facs="tcp:150121:3"/>
ſo ingenuous, as to ſay, <hi>Eamus ad communem errorem?</hi> Can they juſtifie the Lawfulneſs of half Communions, without fighting with their own conſciences, theſe being confeſſedly oppoſite to the primitive inſtitution, and to the known practice, not onely of the Catholick Church, but alſo of the Roman, for many Ages? who would not be mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with indignation, that men ſhould upon deſigne, abuſe their parts and wit to cheat the World? I know not how to reconcile theſe men to themſelves, unleſs it be ſuppoſed, that becauſe they received not the Truth in love, they are given up to ſtrong deluſion, and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. I grant <hi>Bellarmine, Barronius, Perron</hi> and others of that <hi>Cabal</hi> have ſaid much for an ill cauſe. They have indeed ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to be men of great parts, but of very evil conſciences. They who devote their endowments to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trociny of hereſie, would remember that errors in religion are ſuch creaſy and burdenſome ſuperſtructures, that the ſtrongeſt ſhoulders muſt needs ſhrink under them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>My bowels in the mean time do yern toward the ſequaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous multitude in the Roman Communion, who in the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of their hearts ſurrender themſelves, to the conduct of ſuch teachers, How grateful is it to theſe who love eaſie methods of Religion among whom are not only thoſe of the meaner ſort of people, but alſo many of greater quality) to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>red from ſerious inquiries after divine truths, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite ſubmiſſion to infallible guides? and having once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted their faith to thoſe teachers, how ſecure do they judg themſelves, being taught by no meaner Caſuiſt, then Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Tolet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that its not onely ſafe, but alſo meritorius, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the doctrines taught by their teachers though falſe on the matter, untill they know that the Roman Church tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches otherwiſe. Thus the leaders of theſe deluded people cauſe them to err. Nor will the pretended infallibility of their teachers, be ſufficient apology for them at the great day. This rather will be their condemnation, that upon ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:150121:4"/>
pellucide and improbable pretence they ſhould have made ſmall account of the truely infallible Canon of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which God hath charged thoſe to ſearch who would find eternal Life, <hi>Joh. 5. 34.</hi> From this ſearch, nothing doth more deterr people, then the thorny and litigious debates, raiſed by School-men and Controverſists, as if men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved turn Scepticks in religion, if they did not implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intruſt the conduct of their Faith, to a Romiſh infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble guide. But, bleſſed be our God, its not a matter of ſuch inſuperable difficulty, to find out the truth of Religion, in the holy Scripture, as they who deſign the inſlaving peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples conſciences, do pretend; If prejudices once being laid aſide, men would apply themſelves ſincerely to the uſe of appointed means. For the wiſdome of God hath, with a perſpicuity accommodated to the weakeſt capacities, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed theſe things which are neceſſary to Salvation: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>Hilary, In abſoluto &amp; facili eſt Aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas, Non per difficiles queſtiones nos ad vitam Aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam vocat Deus,</hi> and a greater then <hi>Hilary,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle of the Gentiles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>If our goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt;</hi> and a greater then both, our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Joh. 7. 17. If any do the will of God, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God.</hi> One thing I am ſure, its much more eaſie to find out the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in Scripture, then by any means whatſoever to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a rational evidence of Papal or Council infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which yet ought to be preſuppoſed, before an implicite ſubmiſſion to Pope or Council.</p>
            <p>Among the many evils of this generation, nothing ſhould more awake the friends of Truth, zealouſly to appear for her interests, then the indifferent neutrality as to this or the other Religion, which ſeemes to be poſſeſſing the minds of many. This I conceive to be a woeful effect, partly of mens irreligious practices, and partly of the Sceptical Queries of Romanists concerning the divine
<pb facs="tcp:150121:4"/>
Original of the Scriptures; as if they would rather ſhake men out of all Religion, then that they ſhould not give up themſelves to their implicite ſuperstition. Theſe and ſuch like accounts induced me to draw theſe lines, yet with a real indifferency whether they ſhould be publiſhed or not; as not doubting but the ſame things had been, and would be treated of by others of greater abilities, and to more advantage.</p>
            <p>Only, It may ſeem strange, how I of another Nation, and living at ſo remote a distance, ſhould adventure upon this addreſs to your Lordſhip: I must therefore humbly crave leave to give an account of this my preſumption. Theſe Papers having been carried by the hand of a friend into <hi>England;</hi> and without either my knowledge or deſign, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good fortune to arrive at your Lord-ſhips hands; I was told that your Lordſhip was pleaſed not only to caſt a glance of your Noble eye upon them, but alſo, out of your affection to the Truths therein aſſerted, to entertain ſome thoúghts of cauſing print them. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon notice hereof, I reflected on the ſaying of that learn'd and excellent Gentleman, Sir <hi>Charles Wolſely</hi> in his dedication to your Lordſhip of his judicious tract ate of the Reaſonableneſs of Scripture belief, <hi>That the hazard, whereto his Papers were expoſed by your firſt view, would ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure them to all future dangers.</hi> Leſt therefore, My Lord, I ſhould incur the hateful ſtain of ingratitude, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deeply reſent that this ſmall Treatiſe, hath been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with ſo Noble, judicious and impartial a Cenſor. The deference alſo I have to your Lordſhips profound judgment, hath animated me not a little, to conſent with more freedome, to the expoſing of it to the verdicts of a Critical World. The Reader cannot expect from me new dogm's; for though the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> deſerve honour, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the World, with new Phyloſophical inventions; yet new opinions in divinity ſound harſhly, and as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:150121:5"/>
noted long ago, <hi>Quod primum, veriſſimum.</hi> Yea hardly can either new argument or new notion be now expected on the Popiſh controverſies, ſeeing they have been agitated upwards of 150 years, by the moſt learned heads in <hi>Europe.</hi> My whole deſign was to ſhew that the old grounds of our Divines did abundantly confute the new gaudy flouriſhes of Romiſh emiſſaries: Wherein, if in any tolerable meaſure I have anſwered my undertaking, I hope your Lordſhip will not be offended to have your name ſuperſcribed thereto. So confiding that your Generoſity will excuſe this boldneſs of a ſtranger, I ſhall not ceaſe to pray that grace, mercy and peace may be multiplyed on your noble family, and that all the Nobility in his Majeſties dominions, may account it their honour to be zealous for the reformed Religion (which, however it be miſ-repreſented by Romaniſts, is the truely Catholick faith) and Exemplary in the practiſe of Godlineſs. I ſay no more, but ſubſcribe my ſelf.</p>

               <p>It were here eaſie, to repell all the calumnious Criminations thrown upon me by the Cabal of Jeſuites, and to repay them with a volume of too too juſt recriminations, making all their Booffon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries rebound on themſelves.

But as I was not the Aggreſſour in this debate, ſo neither did I undertake it for any perſonal intereſt, I have therefore judged fit to invert a little of the Jeſuits method, he places his invectives in the front of his Book, as it ſeems, that the Patience of the Reader might be out wearied with that nauſeating ſtuffe, before he came to examine the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the argumentative part; but my deſign being to give a teſtimony to the truth, and to contribute my poor endeavours for eſtabliſhing Souls therein, and if it may pleaſe God to recover thoſe that are gone aſtray.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe title of <hi>Papiſmus Lucifugus,</hi> is of hard concoction with the Pamphleter, yet he is not altogether unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in his conjecture concerning it. He ſays, <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. <hi>I gave a ſtrong Thief a ſtrange Name,</hi> I do indeed look on trafficking Jeſuits as pernicious Thieves, they rob men of their deareſt intereſts; of their Religion, and conſequently of their Souls and Salvation. Perhaps this may be one reaſon why Romiſh <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, Revel.</hi> 18.13. Is ſaid to make merchandice of the Souls of men. The conſumptive eſtates of many families in which theſe men do neſt, are a ſhrewd preſumption, they pick purſes as well as conſciences. The Epithet <hi>Lucifugus</hi> had not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ſtrange, had he conſidered that <hi>Tertul. lib. de reſur. Carnis cap.</hi> 47. Long ago branded Hereticks as <hi>Lucifugas Scripturarum,</hi> and it may ſeem ſuitable enough to Jeſuit <hi>Dempſters</hi> tergiverſing humour.</p>
               <p>The Pamphleter, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. takes the boldneſs, to ſay, <hi>That Jeſuit Dempſter deolined not the trial of religion, by Scripture and antiquity.</hi> What will not an effronted Jeſuit affirm? I remit him for his conviction to (one place in ſtead of many) Mr. <hi>Dempſters Paper.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 60.61. Why I pray you did he never anſwer to any teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony either of Scripture or Antiquity brought againſt him? What means the Rapſody of citations in this Pamphlet, but to make a ſeeming ſupplement of M. <hi>Dempſters</hi> defects? Why contend Romaniſts ſo eagerly for the neceſſity of an infallible viſible judge, but becauſe they dare not adventure to have the controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and us dicided, either by Scripture or Antiquity? This Pamphleter thinks to ſalve the matter with a knack of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical equivocation, <hi>we decline not Scripture and Antiquity,</hi> ſaith he <hi>ibid. as carried by Popes, Biſhops, and Prieſts in communion, with him;</hi> that is, they can be judged by Scripture and Antiquity provided they be taken in no other ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> are pleaſed.

were Chancellour of the Aſſize, and had a negative upon the reſt. Is not this a goodly Apology, that Romaniſts are not <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifugi?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To help all, he adds, <hi>That the Queſtion betwixt Mr.</hi> Dempſter, <hi>and me, was onely of the grounds of the Proteſtant Religion, and not at all of the grounds of Popery.</hi> Grant it had been ſo, yet had he not been a <hi>Lucifugus,</hi> would he not have examined the inſtances of Scripture and Antiquity, which were brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Doctrine of Proteſtants? But it would be remembred that Mr. <hi>Dempſter</hi>'s Syllogiſm gave occaſion for an enquiry of a greater Latitude, <hi>viz.</hi> What the reciprocal grounds of the true Religion are, and what the Religion is to which alone theſe grounds do agree; whether Popery, or the Religion of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, I pitched on Scripture and Antiquity, as the peculiar grounds of the true Religion, which do exactly quadrate with the Reformed Religion, and not at all with Popiſh ſuperſtition. But Jeſuit <hi>Dempſter</hi> could never be induced either to give a ground of the true Religion, or to confute that aſſigned by me. If this be not a <hi>Lucifugus,</hi> who ever was? Whether I in giving this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to theſe Papers, or the Pamphleter in quarrelling at it, do <hi>ſtumble at the threſhold,</hi> others may judge. I am not diſpoſed to quarrel at the Title of his Book, <hi>Scolding no Scholarſhip.</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all will give him this teſtimony (neither do I envy it) that he hath behaved himſelf as an abler Scold than a Scholar.</p>
               <p>Albeit Jeſuit <hi>Dempſter,</hi> at the time of our Encounter, was extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Romaniſts</hi> as a <hi>Non-ſuch,</hi> yet his feebleneſs being diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world, by the publiſhing of his inſignificant Papers.

How is it, that when this whole debate was occaſioned by a caſuiſtick Queſtion of Repentance, and thereupon I had given a Specimen of the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Morals of Jeſuits, yet he ſays nothing for the vindication of them? How is it, that he does not at leaſt clear their <hi>Old, Grave, Learned Man,</hi> from that egregious Jeſuitical Fallacy, wherewith I charged him, in the entry of his firſt Paper?

two Arguments which I propounded to M. <hi>Demſter</hi> in the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Debate, and upon M<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Demſter</hi>'s goodly Syllogiſm.</p>
               <p>To my firſt Argument drawn from the impious Doctrine of Romiſh Caſuiſts, that when a man hath ſinned hainouſly, he is not bound to repent preſently, The Pamphleter after a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the matter of Fact (whereof I gave a ſufficient account in the Epiſtle Dedicat. before <hi>Papiſmus Lucifugus;</hi> and of the Atheiſtical abſurdities to which M. <hi>Demſter</hi> was brought, by the confirmations of the major of that argument, which the Pamphleter, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. falſly ſays, <hi>that I did altogether paſs in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.)</hi> I ſay the Pamphleter anſwers, <hi>pag.</hi> 12. <hi>That all hold the ſhorteſt delay of Repentance both ſureſt and beſt.</hi> Behold a Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, that is, a Cheat, to begin with; For this is not the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether ſpeedy Repentance be ſureſt, beſt, and moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but whether repentance be a preſent duty, and non-repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſin? To this he anſwers nothing directly. How impious muſt the Doctrine of theſe Caſuiſts be, when a Jeſuit is aſhamed directly to own it? Yet if his words be narrowly obſerved, they bewray him<hi>: The ſhorteſt delay,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is ſureſt and beſt;</hi> which implies, that to delay repentance may be good and ſure, though not the ſureſt and beſt, <hi>bonum &amp; tutum,</hi> though not <hi>optimum &amp; tutiſſimum;</hi> and therefore, as if the <hi>Con</hi> were turned to a Fox, he ſlily inſinuates an Argument, to prove the Aſſertion which he was aſhamed openly to avouch, viz. <hi>that a ſinner is not bound pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to repent, from the maxim, that affirmative precepts bind ſemper, ſed non pro ſemper.</hi> To which I anſwer, that the Maxim includes a ſolution in its boſom<hi>:</hi> For though affirmative Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts bind not for all times, yet they bind for all convenient ſeaſons. Did not the affirmative Precept, of ſuccouring the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, bind the Prieſt and the Levite, when they paſſed by the wounded man, betwixt <hi>Jericho</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 10. 30, 31, 32.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150121:11"/>
no command at all for repentance. This alſo being avouched by a Grave Doctor, <hi>Franciſcus Victoria,</hi> as teſtifies <hi>Eſcobar, Cap. Cit. Prob.</hi> 24. But beſides, the Pamphleter takes for granted, that the Command enjoyning Repentance is adequately affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which perhaps he may find to be of more difficult proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than he is aware of. When poſitive duties are required to be done at ſuch ſeaſons, the Command does ſurely include a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Command enjoyning Circumciſion on the eighth day, included a negative, prohibiting delay beyond the day preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; when therefore God Commands now to repent, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. <hi>To day not to harden your hearts, Heb.</hi> 3. 7, 8.

               <p>He has another Cavil to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>Ibid. Proteſtants,</hi> ſays he, <hi>teach mens beſt actions to be ſinful, and therefore muſt either confeſs Repentance at no time to be commanded, or that God hath commanded us to ſin.</hi> A fooliſh and blaſphemous inference<hi>:</hi> For Proteſtants do not ſay, that mens actions, as to love God, repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſinful <hi>per ſe,</hi> or in themſelves, but only that, <hi>ex acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denti,</hi> gradual defects cleave unto them, for who can love God ſo well as they ſhould? Read he never that of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Epiſt. 29. <hi>Pleniſſima charitas eſt in nemine, illud autem, quod minus eſt quam eſſe debet, ex vitio eſt, ex quo vitio, non eſt juſtus in terra;</hi> that is, perfect love is in no man, and what is leſs than it ought to be, is ſtained with ſin. Hence it is, that there is no juſt or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs man on earth: From this it only follows, that God commands the action, which in it ſelf is good, as love to God, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though not the gradual defects which through our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cleaves to them. The contrary Doctrine of Papiſts and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of a ſinleſs perfection in time, is repugnant to clear Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8. 10. and is pure <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> as witneſſes <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> in his Dialogue betwixt <hi>Atticus</hi> and <hi>Critobolus, lib.</hi> 1. and <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cont.

               <p>My ſecond Argument was taken from the Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> in <hi>Inſtruct.

In this Argument, the Pamphleter ſays, <hi>I both argued and anſwered,</hi> whereas I only argued<hi>:</hi> But indeed Jeſuit <hi>Demſter</hi> could neither argue nor anſwer. Of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies given to this Argument by this Scribler, <hi>pag.</hi> 12, 13. to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply M. <hi>Demſter</hi>'s defects, I may ſay</p>
               <q>Sunt tricae Apinoe, &amp; ſi quid levius iſtis.</q>
               <p>As <hi>firſt,</hi> he ſays, <hi>There is greater aſſurance of the Prieſts inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than that Miniſters uſe aright the Elements, and pronounce the words of Inſtitution.</hi> As if we could have more aſſurance of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150121:12"/>
ſecret thoughts of a mans heart, than of words audibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, or of viſible actions performed before a whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath promiſed that nothing neceſſary ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Faith or Salvation, ſhall be wanting in his Church.</hi> What then? doth it therefore follow, that our Faith muſt be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſecret intentions, whereof we can have no infallible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? or doth he mean, that a Prieſt can never waver in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in miniſtring Sacraments? Sure I am, he has neither Scripture, nor Canon of Council, nor ſuffrage of Antiquity to warrant ſuch a fancy. Nay, the Canons, which ſuſpend the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Sacraments upon the intention of the Prieſt, ſuppoſe the Prieſt may have undue intentions, or perhaps he meant (for I am here left to Divine at the Pamphleters intentions) that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon uncapable of the Papacy can be choſen Pope. So indeed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit <hi>Valentia</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>Diſp.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>Punct.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 39. <hi>Col.</hi> 223. But this may be convicted of manifeſt falſhood from Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Did not <hi>Bennet</hi> the Ninth, according to <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> in <hi>Chron.

But I ſatisfie my ſelf at the time with the ruthful complaint of <hi>Platina</hi> in the Life of <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the Third, that ſuch was become the ſtate of the Papacy, that he carried the Chair who gave moſt for it. Certainly therefore theſe Romiſh Doctors, who by the forecited <hi>Valentia</hi>'s acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, confeſs the Papal See not to have immunity from ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate Popes, are the more ingenuous.</p>
               <p>The Pamphleter <hi>replies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thirdly, That the want of the Miniſters intenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n may be ſupplied by the intention, deſires, and love of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</hi> But 1. I know not what to make of this, if it be not a yielding of the Cauſe, and a manifeſt contradiction to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their Church. For if the intention of the receiver can ſupply that want, then it's falſly defined by the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> that the Efficacy of Sacraments depend upon the intention of the Miniſter; it ſhould rather depend upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the receiver. 2. A man cannot be ſure of his own Graces. according to Romaniſts; conſequently the Efficacy of Sacraments, and ſo of all their Religion, muſt yet depend upon an uncertain condition: Yea, <hi>Beil. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Juſtificatione, cap.</hi> 8. concludes, that a man cannot be ſure that his ſins are forgiven
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150121:12"/>
him, becauſe he cannot be ſure of the intention of the Prieſt in giving Abſolution, were the matter ſufficiently ſupplied by the receivers intention, deſires, and love to God, how inconſequent were <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s argument. Whither, I pray, did <hi>Bell.</hi> or this Pamphleter underſtand Popiſh principles beſt? But 3. Suppoſe one adult perſon, receiving Baptiſm or Orders, had aſſurance of his own Graces, and of his own intentions and deſires, yet others could not: Conſequently, others could not certainly know, that he were either Baptized or Ordained. But 4. Though the defect of the Prieſts intention could be thus ſupplyed in adult perſons, yet there were no remedy for Infants, who are not capable of ſuch intentions; and therefore the Pamphleter himſelf reſtricts this evaſion <hi>to thoſe that are come to Age;</hi> and ſo there could be no certainty whether Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, who confirmed the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or the preſent <hi>Clement</hi> the Tenth (whom I ſuppoſe to have been baptized in their Infancy) were really bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and conſequently, whether ever they were in a capacity to be Popes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> ſaith the Pamphleter, <hi>The conferring of a Sacrament is not only</hi> actio hominis, <hi>but</hi> humana, <hi>that is a deliberate action. Quid hoe ad Rhombum?</hi> The Queſtion betwixt us and Papiſts, is not, whether it be neceſſary that the Miniſter have a deliberate intention to go about the outward Sacramental action; that we freely grant, and that is ſufficiently known by the grave out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performance of the work, becauſe <hi>Ambroſius Catharinus</hi> required no more as ſimply neceſſary to the being of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now ſure it is, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſpecial Revelation, none can have infallible certainty, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother has ſuch an intention, and this is a further intention than is requiſite, <hi>ut actio ſit humana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>fifthly,</hi> ſaith the Pamphleter (for I ſee <hi>Con</hi> muſt have many holes to retire to) <hi>What if a Mad man be in a frolick, or a Comedian in a jeer ſhould pour out Water on any one, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the words, were it a Sacrament?

May not this Simile with more reaſon be inverted thus<hi>:</hi> When Jeſuit <hi>Dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> alledged I was his Debtor, I not only told the Allegation was falſe, and therefore required him, as he would not be held a Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, to prove the Debt, by Bond or otherwiſe, which he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do, but alſo I charged him as being my Debtor, for which I produced ſuch Evidence as he could not control, only as if Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits had an Art of paying their Debt by bold Aſſertions, he had the confidence oft to ſay, I was owing him; and this procedure is juſtified by the Pamphleter. Now whether M. <hi>Demſter</hi> as Debtor, or the Pamphleter as Procutor, have diſcovered leaſt ſincerity, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may judge.</p>

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:150121:15"/>
It is further to be noted, that the Pamphleter in that <hi>pag.</hi> 34. <hi>maintains, that without an Infallible Judge of Controverſies, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſſured either of the incorrupt writings, or ſincere Doctrine of Fathers, or of the incorrupt Letter, or genuine ſenſe of Scripture;</hi> by which, with one daſh, he hath deſtroyed the whole Plagiary heap of Teſtimonies from Scripture and Antiquity, which are raked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Pamphlet, to which there can be no Faith given without the ſentence of his Infallible viſible Judge, that is of the Pope, for I know none elſe they have at preſent pretending to Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, there being no General Council at the time. And <hi>Greg. de Valentia lib.</hi> 8. <hi>de Annal. fid. cap.</hi> 7. puts the matter out of doubt. <hi>Eadem</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>eſt Authoritas Infallibilis quae Pontifici Romano &amp; quae Eccleſiae ſive Conciliis tribuitur, nam illa ipſa Authoritas quae in uno Pontifice reſidet, Authoritas dicitur Eccleſiae &amp; Conciliorum;</hi> that is, it is the ſame Infallible Authority which is aſcribed to the Pope, and to the Church or Councils; for the ſame Authority which reſides in the Pope alone, is ſaid to be the Authority of the Church, and of Councils. So that hither the ſtate of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie betwixt us and Romaniſts is reduced, whether the Popiſh Religion is to be believed to be the only true Religion, becauſe their Infallible Judge, that is the Pope ſays ſo? Is not this a goodly caſe to which Jeſuits would reduce Chriſtianity, to make all Religion hang at the ſleeve of an Uſurping Pope? Is not the Popiſh Cauſe deſperate, when they have no way to prove themſelves to be in the right, or us in the wrong, but becauſe their Pope, a Party and Head of their Faction ſays ſo? The Hinge then of all Controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Romaniſts and us, at leaſt as managed by the Jeſuited Party, returns hither, whether by the Verdict of the Pope, as infallible viſible Judge, or by the holy Scriptures, and conformity with the Faith of the Ancient Church, we are to judge of the truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Proteſtants hold the latter, our Romiſh Miſſionaries the former; let Chriſtians through the world conſider, whether what they or we ſay be more rational.</p>
               <p>I am challenged, <hi>pag.</hi> 24. <hi>as not having candour,</hi> for ſaying, <hi>that Quakeriſm is but Popery diſguized.</hi> But there is leſs candour in the Accuſer; for I only ſaid, if it were otherwiſe, Learned and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men were miſtaken. His frivolous Apologies are like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm theſe men in their Opinion, for many of the Quakers Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are undoubtedly Popiſh Doctrines; ſuch as, that the Scriptures are not the principal and compleat Rule of Faith, that a ſinleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150121:15"/>
is attainable in time, that men are juſtified by a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought within them, that good works are meritorious, that Apocryphal Books are of equal dignity with other Scriptures, that the efficacy of Grace depends on mans free will, that real Saints may totally Apoſtatize, that in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>dwelling concupiſcence is not our ſin, until we conſent to the luſts thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If <hi>Quakeriſm were Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaniſm in puris naturalibus,</hi> as this Scribler doth rant, how comes it that Quakers have ſo much indignation at theſe who go under the name of Puritans, and ſo much correſpondence with Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, with whom before they could not converſe? Do not Non-Conformiſts abhor theſe fore-mentioned Quaker Tenets? The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences at which he hints, betwixt profeſſed Papiſts and Quakers, do at moſt prove that Quakeriſm is diſguized Popery<hi>:</hi> if there were no ſeeming difference, there would be no diſguize in the buſineſs. Cannot Romaniſts, chiefly Jeſuits, transform themſelves into all ſhapes for their own ends? Have not perſons gone under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Quakers in <hi>Britain,</hi> who have been known to be profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Prieſts, Monks, or Jeſuits in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy?</hi> My ſelf did hear a chief Quaker confeſs before famous Witneſſes, <hi>that one giving himſelf out for a Quaker in</hi> Kinnebers <hi>Family near</hi> Montroſs, <hi>was diſcovered to be a Popiſh Prieſt;</hi> and ſome Romaniſts, in this place, have confeſſed the ſame to me. Yet the differences aſſigned by the Pamphleter betwixt Papiſts and Quakers, ſignifie not very much when they are narrowly examined, And firſt, as to Women Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, do not Papiſts hold <hi>Hildegardys, Katherine</hi> of <hi>Sens,</hi> and <hi>Brigit, &amp;c.</hi> for Propheteſſes? Not to mention their Papeſs <hi>Joan,</hi> or how they allow Women to Baptize, as is defined in <hi>Concil. Florent. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct Armen.</hi> As for their <hi>private Spirit,</hi> I pray, what other grounds hath the Romiſh infallible Judge to walk upon, but Enthuſiaſms and pretended inſpirations? For Fathers and Scriptures (according to them) have not Authority antecedently to his Sentenee. As <hi>for Reformation by private perſons,</hi> the whole work of Quakers is to break the Reformed Churches, which is a real deformation, and a promoting of the Popiſh Intereſt; and if there be ſecret Warrants from the Pope for that end, for which there want not preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they have as great Authority as trafficking Popiſh Miſſionaries. Quakers do not ſay, as he alledges, <hi>that they build on the naked Word,</hi> if by the Word he mean the Scripture; nay, in this, as in many other things, they Romanize, <hi>by denying the Scripture to be the compleat and principal Rule of Faith.</hi> I am jealous both Papiſts
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150121:16"/>
and Quakers could wiſh there were not Scripture in the World. Though Quakers ſeem <hi>to make light of Fathers and Councils,</hi> yet they maintain theſe Tenets, which Papiſts ſay are Authorized by Fathers and Councils<hi>:</hi> At leaſt a knack of Jeſuitical equivocation will ſalve all. By this time it may appear, all he hath ſaid, doth not prove that Quakers are not carrying on a Popiſh deſign.

Now the Roman Church is but one particular Patriarchate, and in her greateſt Latitude, of which the Pamphleter talks, <hi>pag.</hi> 46. <hi>as comprehending all theſe who live in communion with the Biſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>p of</hi> Rome, <hi>acknowledging his Headſhip and Supremacy;</hi> She is but a part, yea and the eſſer part of Chriſtendom. Whatever Infallibility therefore may be claimed by the Catholick Church, yet the Roman Church in whatſoever ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, whether defenſive or repreſentative, can have no juſt Title thereunto. Was there any Roman Church known in the Apoſtles days, but that to which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> wrote? But he writes to Her as one ſubject to Errour, yea, and to total Apoſtacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20, 21. <hi>Be not high minded, but fear; for if God ſpared not the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee. Behold therefore the goodneſs and ſeverity of God, on them which fell, ſeverity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but towards thee, goodneſs, if thou continue in his goodneſs, otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.</hi> Would the Apoſtle have written at this rate to the Infallible Chair?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Proteſtants freely grant, that the truly Catholick Church hath immunity from Errours oppoſite to Fundamental Articles, or to theſe Truths, the misbelief whereof is abſolutely, and in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, inconſiſtent with Salvation, were it otherwiſe, the Catholick Church ſhould totally periſh from the earth, which cannot be, as Proteſtants firmly believe, according to the Scriptures. But Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts not ſatisfied with this, plead for an abſolute Infallibility to their pretended Catholick Judge, or <hi>an immunity from all Doctrinal Errours in Religion, greater and leſſer.</hi> Whatſoever Arguments therefore prove not an abſolute immunity of this Judge from the leaſt Doctrinal Errour, fall ſhort of the mark. Of this diſtinction of Truths Fundamental and Non Fundamental, and conſequently of the Errours oppoſite to theſe Truths, that there is not ſuch abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity, in order to Salvation, of immunity from the one, as from the other, there will be occaſion to ſpeak at more length, <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Therefore to wrap up all. In the Romaniſts Aſſertion <hi>of</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:150121:17"/>
                     <hi>the neceſſity of an Infallible viſible Judge,</hi> theſe five things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. 1. That this ſuppoſed Judge hath an Univerſal Supremacy, or a Juridical Authority over the whole Catholick Church, to bind the Conſciences of all Chriſtians with his Sentences, elſe he would not ſerve the neceſſity of the whole Catholick Church. 2. That the priviledge wherewith this Catholick Judge is cloathed, is abſolute Infallibility, or immunity from all Errour, greater or leſſer, in all his Doctrinal deciſions. 3. That the knowledge of the Infallibility of this Judge, is neceſſarily pre-required to every aſſent of Divine Faith. For this cauſe do they contend ſo hard for this priviledge, that all Chriſtian Faith may hang at the Girdle of their Infallible Judge. 4. That this Judge is viſible, that is, a preſent Member of the viſible Church actually exiſting upon Earth. There is no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but the Lord Chriſt is Infallible Judge of all Controverſies of Religion, and that he is viſible in his Humane Nature, but he is not now viſible upon Earth, as a preſent Member of the Church Militant; therefore it is another Judge, actually exiſting upon Earth, for which they plead. 5. That there is a neceſſity of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of this infallible viſible Judge upon earth. It is beyond doubt, that there was an infallible viſible Judge in the Church Militant, when Chriſt and his Apoſtles did converſe on earth. Now the Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted party affirms it muſt be always ſo.</p>
                  <p>From all theſe the ſtate of the Queſtion emerges clearly, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether in the Militant viſible Church there be always a neceſſity of a perſon or perſons endued with a Juridical Authority over the whole Catholick Church, and with infallible aſſiſtance, for deciding all Doctrinal Controverſies of Religion, of whoſe Catholick Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Infallibility every one muſt be perſwaded, before he can give an aſſent of Faith to any Divine Truth; Jeſuited Romaniſts maintain the affirmative, we the negative: Where it's to be noted, that their affirmative being a copulative, conſiſting of many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, if any one of them fail, their whole Cauſe is gone. The proof of this affirmative, in all its branches, was that which the Adverſary ſhould have hammered out, had he really intended to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Conſciences: But any intelligent Reader, upon a ſlender review of his <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. will ſee that this he never once endeavours, but only with ſome frothy flouriſhes to abuſe unwary Souls.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. There can be no ground brought to prove this pretended Infallibility, as in the ſtate of the Queſtion it hath been deſcribed; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it ought not to be believed. The ſequel is evident, eſpecially ſeeing I hope it will not be pretended that the Aſſertion of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary is, <hi>propoſitio per ſe nota,</hi> or carries with it an intrinſick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Nay, Faith being an aſſent founded upon Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where no Divine Authority is interpoſed, there can be no aſſent of Faith. The antecedent ſhall be proved <hi>ſolutione objectionum.</hi> Is not the teſtimony of an infallible viſible Judge the ground of all Divine Faith, according to this Pamphleter<hi>:</hi> If therefore he would have us give an aſſent of Faith to this Article of the neceſſity of an infallible viſible Judge, ought he not to have confirmed it by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of an infallible viſible Judge? But no ſuch teſtimony doth he alledge in all his <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. where he undertakes to diſpute this Controverſie, but only ſome miſapplied ſhreds of Scripture and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, none of which does he hold as teſtimonies of an infallible viſible Judge: The infallible viſible Judge being a living member of the preſent viſible and Militant Church, would it not then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that either this is no Article of Faith for which he contends, or that Articles of Faith are not neceſſarily to be proved by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of an infallible viſible Judge.</p>
                  <p>Though this Argument need no further confirmation, till I come to canvaſe his objections, yet, for his conviction, I will uſe this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. If the neceſſity of an infallible viſible Judge can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then either by Scripture, or by Reaſon, or by Fathers, or by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150121:18"/>
Tradition, or by Miracle, or by Enthuſiaſm, or we muſt believe this Infallibility of their viſible Judge upon his own word, but by none of theſe can it be proved, <hi>ergo</hi> not at all. If my enumeration be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, let him, or any for him, ſupply it; for confirming the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, I ſhortly run through the particulars. 1. Not by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for, according to him, I can neither know the Divine Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, nor ſenſe of Scripture, but by the teſtimony of this infallible viſible Judge: Doth he not then diſcover that he knows not what he does, when he alledges Scripture to prove that there is an infallible viſible Judge? is not this to prove <hi>ignotum per ignotius?</hi> Nor 2. By <hi>Reaſon,</hi> this pretended Infallibility being only from ſupernatural aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt; and ſeeing the neceſſity of the Church may be provided for by an infallible Rule, as ſhall appear <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. Natural Reaſon can neither be expected, nor is it alledged by him to prove it. Nor 3. By <hi>Fathers,</hi> ought not the infallibility of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be firſt proved, before the neceſſity of this infallible viſible Judg be believed for their teſtimony? And how ſhall this be done, ſeeing Fathers confeſs themſelves to be fallible, as ſhall appear Argument 8. Are there not many ſpurious writings paſſing under the names of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Are not the writings of Fathers often ambiguous, dark, and obnoxious to various conſtructions? Are there not in them not only ſeeming, but real contradictions? Is it not beyond controverſie, that in many places the writings of Fathers are vitiated and adulterated? If then there be need of the teſtimony of an infallible Judge to know true uncorrupted Scripture, and the genuine ſenſe thereof, how much more to know the true and uncorrupt writings of Fathers, and their genuine ſenſe? conſequently, the proof of the being of that Judge cannot depend on the teſtimony of the Fathers: Should the neceſſity of this infallible Judge never be believed until it be atteſted by the unanimous ſuffrage of Fathers, then none of the multitude ſhould ever believe it. Are they able in ſuch a thorny queſtion, to find out the unanimous ſuffrage of Fathers? Surely either the neceſſity of this infallible Judge cannot be proved by Fathers, or this Pamphleter is moſt unhappy; for in all his <hi>Farrago</hi> of teſtimonies from Fathers, there is not one aſſerting this thing, as ſhall appear when I come to conſider the objections. Nor 4. By <hi>Tradition;</hi> for, beſides that I ſhall be addebted to any who will prove to me the Theſis here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by Univerſal Tradition; are there not as great debates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning genuine Traditions, and the ſenſe of them as concerning Scriptures? Is there not need of an infallible viſible Judge, to diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150121:19"/>
genuine Traditions from ſpurious? How was the Church im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon by pretended Tradition, concerning the <hi>Millennium,</hi> and concerning the <hi>Quarto-decimam</hi> Controverſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If Tradition it ſelf muſt be Authorized by the infallible teſtimony of this Judge, then the infallibility of the Judge cannot be proved by Tradition; or if this Poſition can receive ſufficient evidence from Traditions, why may not other Articles of Faith alſo, and ſo there ſhould be no need of an infallible viſible Judge. Hence the great Sticklers for the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary way are known to be but ſmall friends to the infallibility of a viſible Judge. Perhaps then 5. He run to <hi>Miracles:</hi> If there be a gift of Miracles among Romaniſts, are they not very uncharitable, who will ſend no Thaumaturgick Miſſionaries to <hi>Scotland?</hi> Do they judge us ſo credulous, as to be ſhaken with the fabulous Legends of Miracles, pretended to be wrought in the <hi>Indies,</hi> or in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia?</hi> I ſincerely profeſs, one real Miracle ſhould have more weight with me, than a million of their Pamphlets. Of Miracles, <hi>I</hi> hope to ſpeak more, <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. Now only <hi>I</hi> have two Queries. 1. When ever was there a true Miracle wrought to confirm this point of Controverſie, that there is a neceſſity of an infallible viſible Judge? or that the Pope or his Council is this Judge? inſtance who can. 2. How is a true Miracle to be diſcerned from a falſe? I the rather enquire this, becauſe <hi>Bell. lib. de not. Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 14. poſitively affirms, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Miracles muſt be known by the teſtimony of the Church; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he means, this infallible viſible Judge<hi>:</hi> Then ſure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of this Judge is not to be proved by Miracles: But Circles and Labyrinths are fitteſt Engines to ſupport this myſtery of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Muſt we then 6. Believe this Judge to be infallible, <hi>becauſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſays ſo;</hi> Behold to what a pinch theſe men reduce Chriſtianity! Ye can have no ground, according to them, to believe Scripture, or Chriſt, or any Article of Religion, but upon the teſtimony of their infallible viſible Judge; that is, ſaith the Jeſuited party, the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> But how ſhall ye be aſſured that he is infallible? Ye muſt, forſooth, take this upon his own word. Is not this to make Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ridiculous? Why ſhall I not as well believe a Quaker on his own word, who will affirm his Dreams with as great confidence as any Pope of <hi>Rome?</hi> is not this prodigious impiety? The Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God ſpeaking in the Scriptures ſhall not be believed for it ſelf, albeit it have ſo ſtrong a confirmation from extrinſick motives of credibility, which the infallibility of Pope or Council never had, but the teſtimony of a Pope ſhall be believed infallible on his bare

word. Is not this to verifie that ſaying of our Saviour, Joh. 5. 43. <hi>I am come in my Fathers Name, and me ye receive not; if another come in his own name, him ye will receive?</hi> Muſt not theſe men have either Vaenal Conſciences, or elſe be great Maſters of their Reaſon, that can lay the ſtreſs of their Salvation upon ſo crazy a Foundation? Now 7. I know nothing that remains, except with the Quaker, they run to <hi>Enthuſiaſtical Revelations,</hi> for this their pretended infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And he may remember, how in a like caſe, I minded M. <hi>Dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of a diſcourſe of <hi>Cloppenburg,</hi> the Title whereof is, <hi>Papiſtarum &amp; Enthuſiaſtarum diſcordia concors.</hi> Only both Romaniſt and Quaker muſt give us Proteſtants leave, to deſire a ſight of their Credentials, elſe we cannot take them for divinely inſpired Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This one negative Argument is ſufficient to prove our negative Hypotheſis, and to diſcover the fallacy of this ground of the Romiſh Religion. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps my Adverſary will ſay as another ſcribling Jeſuit <hi>E<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> W.</hi> in his vain diſcourſe, entituled, <hi>Proteſtancy without Principles,</hi> againſt two eminently Learned Perſons, D. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and M. <hi>Poole, That we muſt poſitively prove that there is no infallible viſible Judge;</hi> but I muſt advertiſe him, to diſtinguiſh betwixt our Faith, and the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Errours, as no part of our Faith. It ſuffices a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant not to believe the neceſſity of any infallible viſible Judge, and to declare that to be no part of our Faith; and this is abundantly warranted by this one negative Argument. Let the Pamphleter try how he can diſprove it without Sophiſtry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 2. The Seat of this Infallibility, or this infallible viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judge, is not aſſignable; therefore this infallible viſible Judge is but a <hi>Chymera:</hi> The ſequel I prove, Had God appointed an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble viſible Judge, upon whoſe teſtimony the Faith of all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world ſhould be reſolved, he would ſurely have determined who this infallible Judge was, elſe, as M. <hi>Poole</hi> ſays well in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix againſt <hi>Everard, pag.</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God ſhould deal with the World, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who when he was asked, to which of his Captains he left his Empire, anſwered, the beſt; but not defining who was beſt, this became a Seminary of contention, or, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes the compariſon, like the dying Father, who having two Sons, <hi>Leon,</hi> and <hi>Pantaleon,</hi> and being enquired to whom he would leave his Eſtate, anſwered <gap reason="foreign">

Church, aſſuring us that there is an infallible viſible Judge, but not revealing who he is? if it be not known who he is, people can no more reſolve their Faith upon his Authority, than if he were not<hi>:</hi> if therefore God had intended ſuch a way, ſurely he would have determined who he is. It remains therefore only that I prove the Antecedent, for which I need no more, but give an account of the diviſions of Romaniſts concerning this thing<hi>:</hi> if ſuch an infallible viſible Judge were aſſignable, could not Romaniſts, at leaſt, who talk ſo much of him, agree upon him? But who is ſuch a ſtranger in the world, as not to know their irreconcileable debates about this point?

But there be on the other hand no leſs conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Doctors, <hi>Qui non in Pontifice ſed in Concilio Generali conſtituunt infallibilitatem judicii de rebus Fidei,</hi> ſays <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 2. who place this infallibility not at all in the Pope, but in the General Council only; and for this he cites the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Doctors, <hi>Gerſon, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynus, Alphonſus à Caſtro,</hi> yea and Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the Sixth. Loe here contradictory Opinions touching this thing among Romaniſts, and yet <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 2. hath the confidence to ſay, <hi>that all Romaniſts agree in this, that the Pope and the Council cannot err.</hi> But this is both falſe on the matter, and a perfect Cheat. Firſt, I ſay falſe on the matter, for there be yet a third ſort of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors among Romaniſts, who do affirm, that both Pope and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council may err in matters of Faith, and that the ſubject of infallibility, is <hi>multitudo fidelium,</hi> the diffuſive Body of Believers.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150121:20"/>
Of this Opinion were <hi>Occam, Panormitan, Petrus de Alliaco, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſis, Antoninus,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Cuſan, Nicolaus de Clemanges:</hi> The pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ye will find cited by Learned D. <hi>Barron,</hi> in <hi>Apodixi Catholica, Tract.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. 21. and by <hi>H.

I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cite one ſhort ſentence of famous <hi>Occam, Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Dialog. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 31. where he lays down this concluſion, and maintains it; <hi>Tota multitudo clericorum poteſt contra fidem Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam errare &amp; per conſequens totus clerus non eſt illa Eccleſia quae contra fidem errare non poteſt.</hi> That is the whole multitude of the Clergy may err againſt the Catholick Faith, and conſequently the whole Clergy is not that Church, which cannot err in matters of Faith. But ſecondly, thoſe Romaniſts who ſay they do agree in this, that the Pope and the Council cannot err, do put a Cheat upon the world, as is ſolidly demonſtrated by the Learned D. <hi>Barron, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixi Catholica, tract.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. for they do not mean that this infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility is partly ſeated in the Pope, and partly in the Councils, nor are they at all agreed concerning the ſeat of this infallibility; for the one half of them, namely the Jeſuited party, hold the Pope only to be the ſubject of this infallibi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ity, and not the Council at all. Hence <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 3. ſaith expreſly, <hi>Totam firmitatem Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorum legitimorum eſſe à Pontifice, non partim à Pontifice, partim à Concilio.</hi> The other half are as peremptory by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his own confeſſion, that the infallibility is ſeated in the Council only, and not at all in the Pope. So that the Jeſuited party might as well ſay, that the Pope and M. <hi>Con</hi> are infallible, as that the Pope and the Council are infallible; and the other party might as well ſay, that the Council and M. <hi>Con</hi> were infallible, as the Council and the Pope. Yea, Jeſuits might ſay with as much candour, as D. <hi>Barron</hi> obſerves, <hi>cap.</hi> 20. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. that they were agreed with Mahumetans, that the Pope and the Alcoran were infallible. By this alſo, I hope, it will appear how vainly they boaſt, as if by their infallible Judge they had an eaſie way to terminate Controverſies, and a ſure ground of Union amongſt themſelves; whereas the infallible Judge cannot agree them concerning this Fundamental of their Religion, nor terminate this controverſie among them, whether there be an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible viſible Judge, or who he is. Neither can the Pamphleter make his eſcape by the tergiverſing evaſion he uſes, <hi>pag.</hi> 44. <hi>That the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not, who this infallible Judge is, but whether there be one:</hi> I ſay, thus he cannot eſcape, for I argue from the one to the other.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150121:21"/>
It cannot be ſhewed who is this infallible Judge, therefore there is none; both antecedent and ſequel I have proved. Ought not the Pamphleter in this caſe, for reſolving the <hi>an ſit,</hi> whether there be ſuch a Judge, define thee <hi>quis ſit,</hi> who he is? it's the deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Cauſe that makes him ſometimes tergiverſe, and ſhun to declare who is the infallible Judge.

                     <hi>which the Church hath given a prior definition, and may endeavour to obtrude it upon others by his definitive Sentence, but that he cannot give Sentence for an errour not manifeſt,</hi> or for an errour againſt which the Church hath paſſed no former definition. I am ſure there is no <hi>Veſtige</hi> either in Scripture or Antiquity for ſuch a diſtinction, nor yet is it agreeable to ſound Reaſon, it being much more eaſie to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an errour not manifeſt, than into a manifeſt errour, there being more means to preſerve from manifeſt, than from not manifeſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; if therefore the Popes infallibility doth not ſecure him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt manifeſt errours, much leſs againſt not manifeſt errours: if the Scriptures alledged for infallibility prove not his immunity from manifeſt errours, how ſhall his immunity from not manifeſt errours from them to be concluded. The Pope, as a private perſon, may be ſmitten with a not manifeſt errour by the confeſſion of <hi>Valentia;</hi> if then the exigence of the Church require a deciſion of that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, muſt not the Pope diſcern according to his private errour? It's a piteous off come of the Jeſuit, that God will take away the Pope by death, leſt he ſhould paſs ſentence for ſuch an errour. A goodly paſs indeed to which his Infallibility is brought; M. <hi>Dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and this Pamphleter, ſpake of Infallibility as a ſpecial aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt guiding their Judge unto all truth, but now it's turned to an act of ſeverity in killing the Pope, leſt he ſhould give out an erronious ſentence. But ſeeing God in the depth of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath ſpared Popes to confirm manifeſt errours by their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, who ſhall aſſure us that he will not permit them alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm not manifeſt errours? To this it's anſwered, <hi>That there is more hazard to the Church by a not manifeſt errour, than by a manifeſt one; for when the Pope defines contrary to a prior definition, then he is known to be a Wolf, and not a Paſtor; but when he defines a not manifeſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, then there is no mean left to know him to-be an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Impoſtor, and ſo the Church were bound to aſſent to his erronious Sentence.</hi> But this Reply takes for granted two manifeſt untruths. Firſt, that there is no ground by which to diſcern Truth from Errour, but the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, whereas, when the Church is firſt to define a Truth, ſhe muſt have ſome ſure ground why ſhe gives Sentence for this rather than for the contradictory thereof, conſequently there muſt be a ground by which to diſcern Truth from Errour antecedent to the Churches Sentence. Secondly, that the Church is bound to aſſent to the erronious Sentence of a Pope<hi>:</hi> But where ever did God ſo far inflave the Conſciences of his people to erronious Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150121:24"/>
Moreover, the hazard to the Romiſh Church appears to be much the ſame, whether the Errour for which the Pope defines be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt or not, for by his definition it becomes not manifeſt to them, he having a multitude of Paraſites to deviſe diſtinctions and gloſſes to elude prior definitions, as either not being definitions of the Church, or not contrary to this. As fell out when <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. paſſed his Sentence in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council for the Popes Supremacy, contrary to the definitions of the Church in the Councils of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> how many Advocates were ſet on work to maintain that theſe definitions of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> were no definitions of the Church, or of Oecumenick Councils? In a word, ſo manifeſt it is that Popes may err in <hi>Cathedrâ</hi> concerning matters of Faith, that the ſame is aſſerted by eminent Romiſh Doctors, as <hi>Gerſon, Almaynus,</hi> Pope <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> 6. <hi>Alphonſus à Caſtro, &amp;c.</hi> cited by <hi>Melchior Canus lib.</hi> 6. <hi>loc. com. cap.</hi> 1. and by <hi>Azorius, Part.</hi> 2. <hi>Moral. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.

                  <p>Next, as to <hi>Councils,</hi> Proteſtants have much more reſpect for real Oecumenick Synods, conſiſting of Paſtors from all true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Jeſus Chriſt, than any Jeſuited Papiſts. Proteſtants acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that real Oecumenick Synods are the Supreme viſible Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick Judge of Controverſies of Religion; and that they have choice promiſes of God for their aſſiſtance, if they ſincerely ſeek his glory, and the diſcovery of truth<hi>:</hi> Yet there not being promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that all the members of an Oecumenick Synod, or greater part of them, ſhall infallibly obſerve the conditions upon which that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit may be expected. Nay, on the contrary, ſeeing in theſe Meetings much may be done through faction or intereſt, and thoſe who come thither in ſimplicity may be byaſſed by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of others, therefore we cannot aſſert an abſolute infallibility of Councils.

all their infallibility upon the ratification of the Pope. <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 1. deals plainly; <hi>Conciliorum Judicium tum fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum &amp; ratum eſt, quum acceſſerit ſummi Pontificis confirmatio, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde ultimum judicium eſt ſummi Pontiſicis;</hi> ſo they eſteem of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils only as they ſerve their intereſts.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Is it poſſible for any man to reconcile the Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent, Seſſ.</hi> 22 <hi>Can.</hi> 9. <hi>of celebrating the Worſhip of God in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue;</hi> with 1 <hi>Cor. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 11. If I know not the meaning of the voice, I ſhall be to him that ſpeaketh a Barbarian, and he a Barbarian to me. Then ſure the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> eſtabliſheth a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Worſhip in the Church, inſomuch that their own <hi>Cajetan</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. ſaith, <hi>Ex hac</hi> Pauli <hi>Doctrina habetur quod melius ad aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationem Eccleſiae eſt orationes publicas, quae audiente populo dicuntur dici lingua communi &amp; clericis &amp; populo, quam dici Latinè.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Doth not the Decree of the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and of <hi>Trent, concerning the Religious Adoration of Images,</hi> directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. yea, and the Univerſal practiſe of the Ancient Church. They may ſee this from their own <hi>Piche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. in diſſert. de imag.</hi> but theſe, and ſuch like inſtances, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me upon the proſecution of other Controverſies.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore now hint at a few other examples; and firſt I would have Romaniſts reſolve, whether the General Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> did err when it enacted, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>Can.</hi> 28. and <hi>Act.</hi> 16.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150121:25"/>
                     <hi>that the Patriarchs of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>have equal priviledges with the Biſhop of</hi> Rome. If it did err, then General Councils may err; if not, then the Supremacy of the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> falls to the ground. I know <hi>Baronius, Binnius,</hi> and <hi>Becanus,</hi> alledge that Act to be of no force, as not being approved by the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Legats. But it rather follows, that the Fathers of the Primitive Church were not of the preſent Romiſh Faith, concerning the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and the dependance of the force of Decrees of General Councils upon the Popes approbation<hi>:</hi> For though the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, who had withdrawn themſelves from the Council at the firſt making of this Canon, did deſire the Act to be reſcinded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the diſſent of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſpared not to ſuggeſt that it was carried on in a diſorderly and factious way, the whole Council unanimouſly adhered to the Act, and cryed out, <hi>Haec juſta ſententia, hoc omnes dicimus, quae conſtituta ſunt valeant, omnia recte Decreta ſunt.</hi> Sure either this Council deſtroys the Popes Supremacy, or if it erred, the infallibility of Councils falls to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Did not the ſecond Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> err groſly in giving ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for the <hi>Eutychean Hereſie?</hi> And the Councils of <hi>Sirmium, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum, Antioch, Tyre, &amp;c.</hi> who did approve, or at leaſt interpolate the <hi>Arrian Hereſie?</hi> Nor will it ſalve the matter to ſay, that they were unlawful Councils. For what made them unlawful? Not the want of a due Authority, they being Convocated by Imperial E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, as well as the four famous uncontroverted General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and ſome of them were very numerous, only they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, becauſe they pronounced erroneous Decrees. Perhaps it will be replyed, that they were not approved by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> if that rendred them invalid, how came it that the Ancient Fathers, when they were urged with the Authority of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, did not caſt them on that account? Can a Poſt-nate appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Pope make that true which in it ſelf was falſe? What a goodly infallibility of a Council is that, which ariſes from the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the Pope; as if a Council began to be infallible, after it had ceaſed to be? I can imagine no tolerable ſenſe in this, but that the Council of it ſelf is fallible, and that the whole infallibility is to be refounded on the Pope. But that Popes have erred, both in the Chair, and out of the Chair, I hope I have already proved<hi>:</hi> What need I more? Have not Councils alſo approved by Popes er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Was it not an abſurd errour in the <hi>Council of Neo-Caeſarea,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

Might not inſtances be given of Councils confirmed by Popes decreeing contradictions? Were there not contradictory Councils at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the ninth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, concerning <hi>Photius</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> approved by the Legats of the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and both declared Oecumenical, by no leſs te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony than the Latin or Greek Church?

The contradictions betwixt the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> on the one hand, defining the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to be above the Pope, and of the <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. on the other, defining <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 11. the Pope to be above the Council; are ſo evident, that Jeſuit <hi>Azorius Part.</hi> 2. <hi>Inſtit.

approved by <hi>Leo,</hi> ſo was the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> by Pope <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> 5. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 45.

                  <p>Is this any new Aſſertion of Proteſtants, that Councils are falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Was not this taught by <hi>Auſtin</hi> in many places, particularly in that luculent teſtimony, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Baptiſm contra Donatiſt. cap.</hi> 3. which I had cited againſt Jeſuit <hi>Demſter,</hi> wherein <hi>Auſtin</hi> prefers the holy Scriptures to all writings of Popes and Councils, and in the end concludes, <hi>Plenaria Concilia priora à poſterioribus emendari,</hi> that the former Plenary or Oecumenick Councils, may be corrected by the poſteriour; therefore he ſuppoſes that Plenary Councils may be ſmitten with errour. To this the Pamphleter replys, <hi>pag.</hi> 43. <hi>that</hi> Auſtin <hi>ſpeaks not there of deciſions of Faith,</hi> which he borrows from <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de concil. cap.</hi> 7. but it hath been often confuted; for the queſtion which <hi>Auſtin</hi> is there diſputing, is a queſtion of Faith; <hi>namely, whether the Baptiſm of Hereticks be real Baptiſm, and whether they who are baptized by Hereticks ſhould be rebaptized.</hi> The Donatiſts to confirm their Opinion, alledged the Authority of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> under him<hi>: Auſtin</hi> therefore to enervate that Objection, ſhews that Scripture is to be preferred to the writings both of Fathers and Councils, and that former Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, though Plenary and Oecumenick, may be corrected by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Councils. This Anſwer had been impertinent, had he only been ſpeaking of <hi>queſtions of Fact,</hi> and not <hi>of Faith:</hi> For the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts muſt have replyed, though Councils may err in matters of Fact, yet the preſent queſtion betwixt them and him was dogmatical, yea the words of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which the Pamphleter, tracing <hi>Bell.</hi> footſteps, doth urge for his expoſition, do make againſt him, for he ſays not only that Prior Councils are amended by Poſteriour, <hi>quum aliquo rerum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimento aperitur quod clauſum eſt,</hi> which is done in matters of Fact, but alſo <hi>quum cognoſcitur quod latebat,</hi> which is done in matters of Faith; which alſo is obſerved by <hi>Stapleton, controv.</hi> 6. <hi>q.</hi> 3. <hi>art.</hi> 4. <hi>ad.</hi> 1. <hi>arg.</hi> And therefore he betakes himſelf to another evaſion; namely, <hi>that ſubſequent Councils are ſaid to correct former Councils, only becauſe they explain more dilucidly what was wrapt up more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely in former Councils.</hi> But this ſurely is repugnant to the ſcope of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who to refute the Objection of the Donatiſts from the the Authority of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> holds forth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150121:26"/>
this as the priviledge of the Scriptures above all teſtimonies of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils, whether National or Plenary, that of the truth of things delivered in Scripture, <hi>dubitari &amp; diſceptari non poſſit,</hi> it was not lawful at all to doubt<hi>:</hi> But Councils National do yield to Plenary Councils, and latter Plenary Councils do conect the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, whereas if he only meant, that the latter Councils do illuſtrate and explain the former, no priviledge ſhould be aſcribed to the Scriptures beyond Councils, for one Scripture may likewiſe illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate another: It's beyond doubt, when he ſaith, that National Councils cede to thoſe that are Plenary, he means that National Councils may err; therefore when he ſays, that ſubſequent Plenary Councils may correct former Councils, he means alſo, that Plenary Councils may err. Was the Pamphleter ſo ignorant, that he knew not that the evaſion which he took from <hi>Bell.</hi> was anſwered by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; or if he knew, why endeavours he not the vindication thereof. But his work appears to have been all along to pick up any thing that ſeemed to make for him out of other Popiſh Books, not once noting what had been replyed thereto.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I cannot omit the obſerve of <hi>Thomas ab Albiis in ſono Buccinae tract.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 21. that before any can be aſſured of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſiſtance of the Spirit given to Councils in their Judicial Deciſions, they cannot but be intangled with a world of perplexed debates, as to what Councils, and in what caſes this infallible aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is due, concerning the Convocation of Councils, the power of preſiding in them, the preſence of Delegates from all Churches, the manner of Conciliary procedure, the number and weight of ſuffrages, their confirmation, and the reception of Councils by all Churches; Do they not ſhut up Souls in inextricable Labyrinths, who make their Faith to hang on ſuch thorny diſputes? I ſhall cloſe this diſcourſe, concerning Councils, with three teſtimonies, two from Fathers, and a third from a famed modern Romaniſt. The firſt ſhall be from <hi>Athanaſius, Epiſt. de Synod. Arimin. &amp; Seleuc. pag.</hi> 873. <hi>edit.

Si vera ſcribere oportet, ita ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo affectus ſum, ut omnia Epiſcoporum Concilia fugiam, quoniam nullius Concilii finem laetum fauſtumque vidi;</hi> that is, to ſpeak the truth, I am ſo diſpoſed, that I deſire to ſee no more Councils, for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150121:27"/>
I never ſaw any of them had a good and comfortable iſſue. I do not mention this teſtimony of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> to diſcredit all Councils, God forbid, I impute only that whereof he complains to the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of thoſe times; yet by this teſtimony it clearly appears, that the Father judged not Councils abſolutely infallible. The third te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony from a modern Romaniſt, <hi>Thomas ab Albiis in Sono bucci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae, tract.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. touches both Popes and Councils, where he compares the (ſuppoſed) corruption of the Rule of Faith made by Hereticks, (ſo he deſigns Proteſtants) to an Ulcer in the Skin, and outward parts of the body, which is not ſo very dangerous, but he reſembles the aſcribing of Judiciary Infallibility to Pope or Council, whereby they are exalted above all that is called God, unto an Ulcer in the bowels, which diffuſes its poyſon through the vitals, and kills the perſon<hi>:</hi> And ſo much of this Argument 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 4. If there be an infallible viſible Judge, he muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in giving definitions of Faith either diſcurſively, or by Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical inſpiration, but by neither of theſe ways can he proceed; <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, &amp;c.</hi> If any challenge the enumeration in the major, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him to aſſign another way of his procedure, till which, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to confirm the minor. And 1. Doth this Judge proceed by <hi>Prophetical Inſpiration?</hi> Are all the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> Prophets? Had Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 4. <hi>Martin</hi> the 5. <hi>Eugenius</hi> the 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Where are their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Credentials correſpondent to ſuch extraordinary Inſpirations? The Apoſtles ſpake with Tongues, and wrought Miracles<hi>:</hi> Had Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 3. <hi>Julius</hi> the 3. <hi>Pius</hi> the 4. or the <hi>Trent</hi> Biſhops, ſuch Seals of their Apoſtleſhip? Is there not as good cauſe to believe the Divine Inſpirations of deluded <hi>Quakers,</hi> as of Popes, or Papalings? Muſt all be believed to be divinely inſpired, who ſay they are? Hath not God left us a Rule by which to judge of Impoſtors? And what elſe is that Rule but the holy Scripture, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8. 20. Is not this a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iſſue of Papal infallibility? Papiſts and Quakers are not ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies as they would make the World believe. Some may think, perhaps, I play upon Romaniſts, when I charge them with Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſms, but I do them no wrong; it's the Doctrine of their own greateſt Authors. <hi>Stapleton controv.</hi> 4. <hi>q.</hi> 2. <hi>in explicat.

For to uſe diſcourſe to infer a concluſion, and yet to expect that the concluſion ſhall not be inferred by argumentation, but only be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by Enthuſiaſm, or Divine Inſpiration, <hi>eſt velle &amp; nolle argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentari:</hi> Surely the definitions of this infallible Judge not depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the premiſes, nor being inferred by them, but being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired, according to <hi>Stapleton,</hi> they cannot properly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, but muſt be Divine Oracles; is not this to eſtabliſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Enthuſiaſm? were this a truth, ought not the definitions of this infallible Judge be joyned to the holy Scripture? Neither want there Authors among Romaniſts who aſſert this; as <hi>Teſtefort</hi> the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, cited by <hi>Rivet, cap. cit.

If therefore they ſay that this Judge proceeds diſcurſively, which was the other branch of the Aſſumption, I argue againſt them thus: 1. Then this infallible Judge muſt have a clear and infallible, yea, and a publick ground (for now he proceeds not by ſecret Enthuſiaſm) from which he deduces his definitions; and if the Judge antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his definitions have a clear ground to believe that which he is to define, why may not others alſo believe upon the ſame clear grounds, without the ſentence of an infallible viſible Judge? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly either the Judge defines an Article of Faith, which himſelf does
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:150121:28"/>
not believe, but conſequently to his own definition, and becauſe he ſays it himſelf, or if he believe it before he define it, then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible viſible Judge is not neceſſary; For that, without which Faith may be had, is not ſimply neceſſary to Faith, but Faith may be had without the ſentence of an infallible viſible Judge, as appears in that antecedent Act of Faith which the Judge hath before his own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; therefore the ſentence of an infallible viſible Judge is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply neceſſary to Faith<hi>:</hi> or if Romaniſts will needs ſtill maintain it to be neceſſary, it will be neceſſary, and not neceſſary, neceſſary <hi>ex Hypotheſi,</hi> not neceſſary, becauſe the Judge hath Faith antecedently to his ſentence. Is it not a Noble Poſition which drives the Aſſerters thereof either upon the Rock of Enthuſiaſm, or elſe involves them in a contradiction? But ſecondly, this Judge proceeding diſcurſively in his definition of Faith, is fallible in the premiſes, <hi>ergo,</hi> he is falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble alſo in the concluſion: The ſequel is clear, it being impoſſible to deduce a true concluſion from falſe premiſes. Whatever may ſeem to follow <hi>ratione formae;</hi> yet nothing can <hi>ratione materiae,</hi> ſeeing, as Philoſophers demonſtrate, <hi>aſſenſus concluſionis attingit objectum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſarum,</hi> if therefore the premiſes be falſe, the concluſion muſt be likewiſe falſe<hi>:</hi> The antecedent is acknowledged by Romaniſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

that infallible Judge, but either Pope or General Council, or both joyntly. The antecedent is proved by a threefold medium. 1. From the caſe of Schiſm. 2. Of Simony. 3. Of the want of due intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Miniſtry of Sacraments. I ſay firſt from the <hi>caſe of Schiſm;</hi> there have been many grievous Schiſmes in the Romiſh Church, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their vain pretence of Unity. <hi>Onuphrius in Chronol. Pontific.</hi> reckons out no leſs than thirty, one of which laſted from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the ſixth to the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> no fewer than fifty years, if we believe <hi>Onuphrius.</hi> There have been two or three Popes at once; <hi>Alter in alterum ſaeviebat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Genebrard:</hi> All this while <hi>Bell.</hi> confeſſes, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Pontific. cap.</hi> 14. that it was an hard matter to know which of them was the lawful Pope. Was all Chriſtian Faith gone from the Church becauſe of the uncertainty of this infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judge? 2. The ſame is more luculently confirmed from the <hi>caſe of Simony.</hi> It's acknowledged by Romaniſts, that Simony makes void the Election of a Pope, as is held out by <hi>Gratian</hi> in the Canon Law, <hi>Cauſa</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. Now that there have been many Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal intruſions into the Papal Chair, is as evident as that any in thoſe late times poſſeſſed it without Simony. Hence <hi>Platina in vitae Sylveſtri</hi> 3. <hi>eo tunc Pontificatus devener at ut qui plus largitione valeret is tantummodo dignitatis gradum bonis oppreſſis &amp; rejectis obtineret, &amp;c.</hi> The Papacy in thoſe days was come to that paſs, that he who by Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery could do moſt, alone obtained the dignity, good men being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and rejected; which cuſtom, ſaith <hi>Platina,</hi> would to God our times did not ſtill retain: And <hi>Spondanus, ad Annum</hi> 1033. brings in <hi>Glaber</hi> thus complaining<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Heu ſedes Apoſtolica,</hi> Alaſs thou Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical See, which in the days of old was the glory of the world, art now, oh ſhame! become <hi>Simonis officina,</hi> the Shop and Forge of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus,</hi> and Hammers continually are beating on the Anvil to make helliſh coyn. You may have heard of <hi>Genebrards</hi> complaint, that in the ſpace of 150 years, from <hi>John</hi> 8. to <hi>Leo</hi> the 9. the Papal Chair was poſſeſſed with Apoſtatick Popes, who entered in <hi>non per oſtium ſed per poſticam,</hi> not by the Gate, but by the Poſtern. Once I thought upon the teſtimony of <hi>Cicarella, in vita Sixti</hi> 5. that <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> 5. had come to the Papal Chair with as much innocency from Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacal Penſation, as many of the late Popes; but now I find that his entry alſo was both Simoniacal and perfidious, whereof the Reader may receive a full account from <hi>Henry Foulis</hi> Hiſt. of Romiſh Treaſons, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. from which that Author concludes the nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Elections of ſundry ſucceeding Popes, not only of <hi>

The Simoniacal entry of <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Quintus,</hi> probably had never been diſcovered, had not <hi>Sixtus</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his Simoniacal contract made with <hi>Aloyſius,</hi> Cardinal <hi>de Eſte,</hi> which provoked the Cardinal to tranſmit the original contract ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Sixtus</hi> own hand to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who being lately diſobliged by the Pope, threatned to accuſe him of Simony in a Council at <hi>Andaluſia;</hi> but the ſpeedy death of <hi>Sixtus</hi> prevented the Proceſs. 3. The ſame is yet further confirmed from the Popiſh Doctrine <hi>of ſuſpending the efficacy of Sacraments from the intention of the Miniſters thereof,</hi> according to the Decrees of the Councils of <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Inſtruct. Armen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Both Pope and Council, who only are pretended to be this infallible Judge, may err in queſtions of Fact; therefore alſo in queſtions of Faith, the antecedent is confeſſed by Romaniſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Hence <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 2. ſaith, <hi>Conveniunt omnes Catholici poſſe Pontificem vel cum concilio generali err are in controverſiis facti particularibus, quae ex informatione teſtimoniiſque hominum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipue pendent;</hi> that is, all Romaniſts agree, that not only the Pope as Pope, but alſo with a General Council may err in matters of Fact. If any will adopt that new notion of the Jeſuits of <hi>Clermont,</hi> that the Pope is infallible, as to matters of Fact, he muſt firſt anſwer the arguments brought in the contrary by thoſe of their own party, before I waſte time in confuting ſo notorious a falſhood; and the rather, ſeeing my Adverſary yields, <hi>pag.</hi> 43. <hi>that their infallible Judge may err in matters of fact.</hi> The ſequel is clear, ſeeing the deciſions of many queſtions of Faith with them, have ſuch dependance upon queſtions of Fact, that if the Judge err in the queſtion of Fact, he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150121:29"/>
cannot but err in the queſtion of Faith. To prove this, I ſhall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my ſelf with theſe two inſtances, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> againſt Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts. Firſt, all Articles of Faith are not contained in Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, but ſome are only to be ſetched from Traditions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When therefore this viſible Judge is to determine a point not contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture, to be an Article of Faith, he can have no evidence thereof but from Tradition, nor of the Tradition, but by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Hiſtories and Records of Antiquity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now is it not a meer matter of Fact, whether Records of Antiquity be genuine or corrupted? whether the relation of Hiſtorians be true or falſe? and therefore this viſible Judge may be deceived as to theſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently concerning the Article of Faith, whoſe evidence depends thereupon. But leſt I ſhould ſeem only to argue upon a rarely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent ſuppoſition, take a late example<hi>:</hi> When the Pope and Council of <hi>Trent</hi> defined the number of the Books of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and determined the Apocriphal Books to be Canonical, they had no ground to walk on but Tradition, and here undoubtedly their Errour, in matter of Fact, led them to an errour in matter of Faith; for theſe Apocriphal Books were never received by Univerſal Tradition, ſure not by <hi>Melito, Juſtin Martyr, Athanaſius, Hierom,</hi> the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> yea, nor by <hi>Greg.</hi> 1. as D. <hi>Coſins</hi> hath fully demonſtrated in his Scholaſtical Hiſtory of the Canon of Scriptures. The other inſtance I give, is from the Canonization of Saints, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he proceeds meerly upon humane teſtimonies of the Sanctity and Miracles of ſuch a perſon, in which undoubtedly there may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and falſhood, as <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>other Romiſh Authors confeſs; which cannot but infer Errour, in point of Faith, among Romaniſts. Is it not a queſtion of Faith, whether ſuch a one as <hi>Ignatius, Xavier, &amp;c.</hi> may be invocated as Saints? conſequently fallibility, in matter of Fact, cannot but infer fallibility in matter of Faith.</p>

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. Who ever pretend to be the infallible viſible Judge of controverſies of Faith, either have not Juriſdiction over the whole Catholick Church, or the Church may be without them; <hi>ergo,</hi> there is not a neceſſity of ſuch an infallible viſible Judge, as is deſcribed in the ſtate of the controverſie: The ſequel is evident, becauſe the aſſerting of the neceſſity of an infallible Judge, among other things, imports theſe two, as was ſhewed in ſtating of the controverſie. 1. A Juridical Authority over the whole Catholick Church. 2. That the Church can in no caſe want that Judge. If therefore that Judge have not Juriſdiction over the whole Church, or the Church may be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:150121:30"/>
without him, there is no neceſſity of ſuch an infallible Judge as Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts do contend for<hi>:</hi> The antecedent is eaſily proved, that a truly Oecumenick Council hath Juriſdiction over the whole Church is not denied; but it is clear, that the Church may be without <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> The firſt 300 years, from that Council of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Act.</hi> 15. until the <hi>Nicene,</hi> there was none, when the Church was ſo much toſſed with Perſecution and Hereſie. There have been long intervals betwixt General Councils; theſe divers hundred years really, there have been none: How much the Councils of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Baſil, Florence, Piſa,</hi> and the <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, are queſtioned by Romaniſts themſelves, is ſufficiently known. Many Learned men, as <hi>Gentilletus, Joachimus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus,</hi> have demonſtrated that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was neither free, nor general, nor Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox. Since the <hi>Trent</hi> Conventicle, Papiſts themſelves pretend not to a General Council, nor is there probability in haſt of any; <hi>ergo,</hi> if a Council, or Pope and Council conjunctly be Judge, yet there is no neceſſity thereof, ſeeing the Church may be, and often hath been without that Judge<hi>:</hi> If it be ſaid that the Church never wants Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenick Councils when her neceſſity requires them, it is eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, there were many controverſies of Faith to be decided in the firſt three Centuries concerning Rebaptization, the <hi>Millennium, &amp;c.</hi> yet all that time there was no Oecumenick Council. Are there not many controverſies at preſent in the Roman Church betwixt Jeſuits and Janſeniſts, Dominicans and Jeſuits, Franciſcans and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans? How many debates are among them concerning the ſenſe of many of the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Canons? Is there not need of one Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Council, if that could terminate the debates of Chriſtendom? If therefore the <hi>definition of a living infallible Judge,</hi> as oppoſed to a written inanimate rule, be neceſſary for the reſolution of Faith, then either God is wanting in providing for the neceſſities of his Church, which were Blaſphemy to aſſert, or an Oecumenick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil which very rarely ſits (yea ſome doubts if ever, at leaſt ſince that of <hi>Jeruſalem, Act.</hi> 15. and therefore ſpare not to call it a Black Swan) cannot be that living Judge. As for the <hi>Pope alone,</hi> neither is he abſolutely neceſſary, nor hath he Juriſdiction over the whole Church. I ſay firſt he is not neceſſary, the Church may be without him, not only in the intervals betwixt the death of Popes, and the Election of their Succeſſors, ſometimes for two, ſometimes for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, but eſpecially in caſe of illegitimate intruders, of whom Hiſtory gives a large account; neither when they are, have they Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150121:30"/>
over the whole Catholick Church. Let the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> produce their Patent for ſuch an Univerſal Juriſdiction, and it ſhall be diſproved. Certainly the Ancient Church believed no ſuch thing: Had <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Firmilian</hi> believed this Supremacy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Pope, would thoſe holy Fathers ſo ſtedfaſtly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the determination of the Pope in matter of Rebaptization: Had the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> believed it, would they have given equal priviledges to the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople?</hi> Had <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Church believed it, would they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſuch ſevere Decrees againſt them that appealed to <hi>Rome?</hi> Seeing then the Pope hath no Univerſal Juriſdiction, and both he and General Councils may be wanting, there is no neceſſity of them as the infallible viſible Judge, with power to paſs obligative ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on the whole Catholick Church; and beſide them, there is none who lay claim to ſuch a Prerogative.</p>

That the Pamphleter ſeems to have forgot his Theſis<hi>:</hi> Is he not to prove that there is an infallible viſible Judge? Ought he not then to make uſe of a <hi>medium,</hi> the Faith whereof doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the teſtimony of this infallible Judge? Is not the Faith of the Scriptures, their Divine Original, the ſincerity of the Tranſlation, and ſenſe of the words, grounded, according to this Romaniſt, upon the teſtimony of the infallible Judge? What a jugling circulation then is this, to prove the infallibility of the Judge by Scripture; which, according to them, I cannot believe, till firſt I ſubſcribe to the infallibility of the Judge? How have <hi>Becan, Gretſer, Turnbul, &amp;c.</hi> toiled to ſweating, to extricate themſelves, yet ſtill they remain ſhut up in a circle, believing the Scripture for the teſtimony of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judge, and the infallibility of the Judge for the Scriptures, as may appear by the arguing of this Circulator. But ſecondly, Doth not this miſerable Pamphleter cut the throat of his own cauſe?
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:150121:32"/>
For <hi>pag.</hi> 39. he aſſerts, <hi>That the Supreme Judicatory, whoſe Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is proved by theſe Scriptures, is a General Council compoſed of all the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church.</hi> Now ſure it is, that there is no ſuch General Council in the Church at preſent, nor do Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts alledge there hath been any theſe hundred years. How imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently then were theſe Scriptures brought to prove the actual exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of the infallible viſible Judge? or if the General Council be that Judge, then it evidently follows, that the Church may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Judge, elſe General Councils ſhould ſit without intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thirdly, The utmoſt that can be collected from theſe Scriptures is, that Councils have Judiciary Authority, that proper General Councils have Supreme Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction for deciſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of Religion, and have peculiar promiſes of Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for hitting on the right ſenſe of Scripture, eſpecially in things that are neceſſary to Salvation, providing they ſincerely uſe the means appointed by God, which Proteſtants do not deny. If this were all intended by theſe Scriptures, <hi>non infertur elenchus:</hi> For hence it does not follow, that Councils ſhall always be, or that the major part in General Councils ſhall ſincerely uſe the means appointed by God for finding out truth, or that in their deciſions they never ſhall deviate from truth, (far leſs that an Aſſembly of the Popes ſworn Vaſſals (ſuch as were thoſe that aſſembled at <hi>Trent)</hi> are a lawful Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, or have either Juriſdiction over the whole Catholick Church, or infallibility in their deciſions. Let all the Jeſuits in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> try if they can hammer out this concluſion out of any, or all thoſe Scriptures. Fourthly, Have not Learned Proteſtants a thouſand times vindicated thoſe Scriptures from the corrupt gloſſes of Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts? Ought not this Pamphleter, had he intended to ſatisfie any judicious Reader, have confuted the exceptions of Proteſtants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Popiſh gloſſes? But it ſeems our Miſſionaries do ſo bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the reaſon of their Proſelites, that they ſwallow down all their Dictates, how irrational ſoever, as infallible and unanſwerable O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. I will not trouble this Pamphleter to read large Volums, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling of Pamphlets appears to have been his greateſt ſtudy, I ſhall only remit him to M. <hi>Pool</hi>'s ſhort, but judicious Tractate of the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Romiſh Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where he will find all thoſe Scriptures, and many more to this purpoſe, ſolidly vindicated<hi>: Deut.</hi> 17. 8. in his <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. in his <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. in his <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7, 8, 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20 in his <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. in his <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. Yet fifthly, leſt I ſhould diſmiſs the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150121:32"/>
Reader with any diſſatisfaction, I will give a touch of all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars mentioned in the Objection.</p>
                  <p>I begin with <hi>the</hi> 2000 <hi>years wherein he ſays the Church was Judge before the Scriptures were written.</hi> But what then? is the caſe then and now alike? then the Church had no written Scripture. Does it therefore follow, that now it hath none either? Was the Church Judge in queſtions of Religion? <hi>Quid hoc ad rhombum,</hi> Is that the queſtion, whether the Church, that is, the Rulers or Paſtors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in a Synod, have a Juridical power? is not the queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Repreſentatives be abſolutely infallible in their deciſions of Faith? is a Judicial Authority and Infallibility terms reciprocal? Would he pull down the Thrones of Princes, becauſe they arrogate not Infallibility? If he would have concluded any thing, he ſhould have ſaid, in the Church, in thoſe days, there was a ſtanding ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary infallible viſible Judge, with Juriſdiction over the whole Church. If this he go about to prove, he will endeavour to derive the Pedigree of their Popes and Councils higher than I thought they pretended. I imagined <hi>Peter</hi> had been the firſt of the Series, but now, it's like, they will aſcend to <hi>Adam:</hi> I have lookt upon <hi>Platina</hi> and <hi>Onuphrius</hi> Catalogues of Popes, but there I find not the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of <hi>Antediluvian</hi> and <hi>Anteſcriptural</hi> Popes, from the Creation until <hi>Moſes</hi> time; which, if the Pamphleter look over his Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logick Tables again, will be found to exceed 2000 <hi>years.</hi> In theſe times the Church had the ſame Doctrine, for ſubſtance, which now is written in the Scriptures, taught by Patriarchs and Prophets, and conveyed by Oral Tradition from Parents to Poſterity<hi>:</hi> But becauſe Tradition in it ſelf was not ſo ſafe a way for preſerving Religion in its purity, therefore the Lord was pleaſed to prorogate the lives of Patriarchs to many Centuries: <hi>Adam</hi> lived till <hi>Methuſelah</hi> was above 200 years old, <hi>Methuſelah</hi> lived till <hi>Sem</hi> was near an 100, and <hi>Sem</hi> out-lived <hi>Abraham:</hi> So that this Tradition needed not paſs through more than two hands, betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the ſpace of more than 2000 years; and withal he raiſed extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as <hi>Enoch,</hi> and others. Yet notwithſtanding all theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Adminicles, how ſoon was Religion corrupted, and the World over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſpread with Idolatry and Polytheiſm? But laying aſide extraordinary Prophets, which the Lord then and in after-times rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up, it's more than all the combination of Jeſuits can prove, that in that interſtice of time, there was an ordinary ſtanding infallible viſible Judge with Juriſdiction over the whole Church; which if he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150121:33"/>
prove not, he muſt let me tell him, <hi>peceat ignoratione elenchi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhut up my Reply to this branch of the Objection with two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks: The firſt is, that Romaniſts do not agree among themſelves concerning their inferences from the ſtate of the Church before the writing of Scripture; M. <hi>Serjeant,</hi> and thoſe of the Traditionary way, do only conclude from it, that Oral Tradition is an infallible mean of conveying truth down to Poſterity. But the Jeſuited party, as appears by this Pamphleter, would conclude from it, the neceſſity of an infallible viſible Judge: Their diſagreement in this, and other matters, are a ſhrewd preſumption that they neither have an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judge, nor yet infallible Tradition. But ſecondly, Learned <hi>Tillotſon</hi> in his Rule of Faith, <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. acutely inverts this whole argument, for in that the Lord committed the Doctrine of Religion to writing, after that the World had experienced the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfulneſs of the former way; it ſeems to be a good evidence, that this way by Scripture is the better and more ſecure<hi>:</hi> It being the way of Divine Diſpenſations, to proceed from that which is leſs perfect, to that which is more; and he conceives the Apoſtles rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning concerning the two Covenants, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7. to be very applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to theſe two methods of conveying Religion. If the firſt had been faultleſs, then ſhould no place have been ſought for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps he is happier in his next Allegation, from <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 8. &amp;c. <hi>where there is a Judge in the Church of the Jews to be obeyed, in matters of Law and Religion, under pain of death.</hi> Who ſees not how inconſequential the argument is from the Jewiſh Church to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? The Jewiſh High-Prieſts did marry, neither were any capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Prieſthood among them but the children of Prieſts<hi>:</hi> Will Romaniſts grant this parallel to hold in the Chriſtian Church? Though one man could be competent to govern an National Church, ſuch as the Jewiſh was, ſhut up in one little ſpot of the earth, doth it follow that one man is as capable of an Univerſal Monarchy over the Catholick Church diſperſed through the whole earth? Yet neither from this place can be proved the infallibility of the Jewiſh High-Prieſt or <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> elſe they ſhould have been infallible, not only in matters of Faith, but alſo of Fact: For there is expreſly mention made of queſtions of Fact, <hi>v.</hi> 8. between blood and blood, plea and plea, ſtroke and ſtroke, all which are to be decided by the teſtimonies of men; and in ſuch, Romaniſts acknowledge both Popes and Councils to be fallible. In that Commiſſion <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 8, 9. the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150121:33"/>
Judge, or Civil Magiſtrate, is joyned with the Prieſts, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are commanded equally to acquieſce in the ſentence of both, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of death. I ſuppoſe he will not, becauſe of this, grant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility to the Magiſtrate; how then can he infer from it the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Church Repreſentative? But were the Jewiſh High-Prieſts and <hi>Sanedrim</hi> infallible? I ſhall not ſtand to enquire how <hi>Aaron</hi> the High-Prieſt was ſtained with Idolatry, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 4, 5. how <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the High Prieſt did make an idolatrous Altar, after the Altar of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 11. or what meant theſe general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56. 10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I only enquire, whether the High-Prieſt and <hi>Sanedrim</hi> did err, when they condemned Chriſt as an Impoſtor and Blaſphemer? if they did, as none but Infidels can deny, then the Jewiſh <hi>Sanedrim</hi> was not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; only it may be asked, how did God command obedience to the <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> under pain of death, if they were not infallible? This Query might be anſwered by another: Do the Penal Statutes of Princes, under pain of death, prove them to be infallible? Was it not ſaid to <hi>Joſhua, Whoſoever will not hearken to thee, let him be put to death?</hi> But I anſwer abſolutely, that the active obedience to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Jewiſh <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> was only <hi>when they gave ſentence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

If the Pope command Vice, and prohibit Vertue, the Church were bound to believe Vice to be good, and Vertue evil: But we have not ſo learned Chriſt; the Judge was to give ſentence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, or as <hi>Ezek</hi> 44. 24. <hi>According to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord.</hi> I am not ignorant of the <hi>ordinary Cavil of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, that then the people were to judge of the ſentence of the</hi> Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim, <hi>whether it were according to the Law.</hi> I diſtinguiſh<hi>:</hi> They were to judge of the ſentence of the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> by an Authoritative Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

it does not follow, by a judgment of diſcretion, in order to their own practiſe, I grant. This Romaniſts cannot deny, unleſs they would deveſt the people of Reaſon, and turn them into Bruits. When Romiſh Miſſionaries labour to Proſelite people to the Romiſh perſwaſion, do they not labour to convince them, that it's more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to believe their Church, than to adhere to the Religion of Proteſtants? Is not this to grant them a judgment of diſcretion? How then can they condemn us for that which themſelves allow? Excellently ſaid <hi>Clemens Alex. Stromat. lib.</hi> 7. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But <hi>are we not commanded to hear the Church? Mat.</hi> 18. 17. Yes.

But it's confeſſed by all, that impeccability of Councils cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, therefore neither inerrability.

Hath he not heard the diſtinction, that albeit in ſuch a caſe the Gates of Hell <hi>valent,</hi> yet <hi>non prevalent,</hi> they hurt the Church, but do not wholly overthrow the Church. To conclude, all that I ſuppoſe can be inferred from that Scripture is, that the whole Catholick viſible Church ſhall not err in Fundamentals. Indeed if the whole diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive did err in Fundamentals, the Gates of Hell ſhould prevail, then the Church ſhould be extinguiſhed.

                     </gap>, and the meaning will be, that thou mighteſt behave thy ſelf in the Church, which is the Houſe of God, as a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thus not only Apoſtles, as <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John, Gal.</hi> 2.9. but alſo faithful zealous Miniſters may be termed Pillars. <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> gives the like Titles <hi>Orat.</hi> 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Orat.</hi> 21. to <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius.</hi> So <hi>Baſil Epiſt.</hi> 62. honours the Biſhop of <hi>Neo Caeſarea</hi> with this very Title of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; therefore either <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> judged all theſe perſons infallible, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe none will affirm, or if they did not, then they did not think theſe words to import infallibility. But fourthly, Granting it be ſaid of the Church, yet it makes nothing for the Romiſh Intereſt, many probably ſuppoſing that to be ſpoken of the particular <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine</hi> Church<hi>:</hi> Now particular Churches by the acknowledgment of all may err. If it ſhould be extended to the Catholick Church, what is that to the Roman, ſhe being at the beſt but a particular Church? But whether univerſal or particular Church be here meant, yet if it be not the Church Repreſentative, it makes nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in hand concerning the viſible Judge. But the very Series of the context ſeem to favour them who underſtand the place rather of the Church governed, than governing, that thou (ſays he to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy)</hi> mighteſt know how thou ought to behave thy ſelf in the Houſe of God, which is the Church; that is, how <hi>Timothy</hi> as a Paſtor ſhould carry among thoſe under his charge. Was not the Church in the firſt 300 years the Pillar and ground of Truth, as well as now? yet all that time after the firſt Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſſembled in a General Council; <hi>ergo,</hi> her being Pillar and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150121:36"/>
ground of Truth is not by Conciliary infallibility. But fifthly, Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and not granting, that it were ſpoken of the Repreſentative of the Catholick Church, yet infallibility will never be infallibly deduced from it: Why may not ſhe be called the Pillar and ground of Truth in a politick ſenſe, becauſe Miniſterially ſhe holds forth the Truth; as a Programme, affixed to a Pillar is expoſed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view of others, but not in an Architectonick ſenſe, as if the Church did Authoritatively and infallibly ſupport the Truth; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>columna &amp; firmamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Eccleſiae eſt Evangelicum.</hi> The written Goſpel (for of that he there ſpeaks) is the ground and Pillar of the Church; yea, and <hi>Hierom,</hi> as cited by a <hi>Lapide</hi> on the place, writeth thus; <hi>Eccleſia eſt columna &amp; firmamentum veritatis, quia in ea ſola ſtat veritas firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae, quae ſola ſuſtinet aedificium Eccleſiae.</hi> If the truth alone, as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſays, doth ſuſtain the Church, then doth not the Church in an Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectonick ſenſe ſuſtain the Truth<hi>:</hi> yet do we not deny but the Church is a Keeper, Witneſs, Propounder, and Defender of the Truth. Why may not this phraſe, the Church is the Pillar and ground of Truth, hold forth the Churches duty, what, <hi>de jure,</hi> ſhe ought to do, and not what always, <hi>de facto,</hi> is her practiſe infallibly? Though <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3. it be ſaid, that Rulers are not a terrour to good works, but to evil; yet the Romaniſts will not grant, that Magiſtrates do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and infallibly countenance Godlineſs and Truth, becauſe there he ſpeaks what's their duty, not what always is their practiſe. Why may not the Church be called a Pillar, in regard of ſolidity, though not in regard of infallibility, to ſignifie the difficulty of her removal from truth, though not the impoſſibility? But ſixthly, as <hi>Chillingworth loc. cit. Sect.</hi> 78. does further acutely obſerve concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Scripture; though it were granted that the Church were called the Pillar and ground of Truth, not only becauſe ſhe ought, but alſo becauſe ſhe always ſhall hold forth the Truth, yet Romaniſts loſe their deſign, unleſs they could prove that ſhe ſhall hold forth all truth without any failure. That in the Catholick Church all Truths, neceſſary to Salvation, ſhall be preſerved, is acknowledged by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; but Romaniſts have to prove, that the Repreſentatives of the Catholick Church cannot err concerning any Doctrinal point, which they will hardly evict from this place, in which the Note of Univerſality is wanting, however the Church be ſaid to be the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ground of Truth, yet not of all Truth. Seventhly and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Granting that infallibility were truly predicated of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150121:36"/>
Church, in that time when the Apoſtle wrote, does it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, <hi>crgo,</hi> ſhe is now infallible. It's confeſſed, that then there was an infallible viſible Judge in the Church, endowed with the gift of Tongues and Miracles, the caſe of the Church ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, for founding the Goſpel Church, and compleating the Canon of holy Scripture; but it doth not follow, that it ſhall be ſo in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Age, neither do the neceſſities of the Church require it. Thus I have gone through all the Scriptures alledged by this Pamphleter for his infallibility: whether they prove his Theſis, let them who are not willing to be deceived, judge.</p>
                  <p>The Pamphleters ſecond Objection contains a <hi>Farrago</hi> of abuſed <hi>Teſtimonies of Antiquity. Pag.</hi> 39, 40, 41. To amuſe the ignorant Reader, he hath gathered up from their Manuals, Pamphlets, and Controverſie Books, a heap of impertinent teſtimonies of <hi>Irenaeus, Origen, Cyprian, Chryſoſtom,</hi> both the <hi>Cyrils, Ambroſe, Euſebius,</hi> and <hi>Auſtin;</hi> aſſerting, that the Church ſhall not fail, or be adulterated with Hereſie.</p>
                  <p>To all which I anſwer<hi>:</hi> Firſt, that none of theſe contain the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of an infallible, viſible, or living Judge, they are but broken ſhreds out of the writings of Doctors long ago dead; and ſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Principles, are not a ſufficient ground of Faith to ſuch a myſterious point as he contends for. I anſwer ſecondly, that ſome or theſe are groſly miſ cited, particularly the firſt from <hi>Irenaeus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 49. whereas in all that <hi>lib.</hi> 1. of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> there be but 35 <hi>cap.</hi> Neither ſeems this to be a meer eſcape of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for it's again cited the ſame way, <hi>pag.</hi> 102. But I muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him, for <hi>H. T.</hi> in his Manual of Controverſies, <hi>Art.</hi> 5. (from whom he ſeems implicitly to have taken this and many more of his teſtimonies) miſ-cites the ſame teſtimony of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> after the ſame manner, for which he is juſtly chaſtiſed by M. <hi>Tombs</hi> in his Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm diſcuſſed, <hi>Art.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. They are ſurely to be pitied who ſee with other mens eyes: But by the words of the teſtimony, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he ſhould have cited <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 43. He is no whit happier in his next citation from <hi>Irenaeus, cap.</hi> 62. where he mentions the <hi>cap.</hi> but not the Book, following there alſo his Guide <hi>H. T. loc. cit.</hi> but by the words, I likewiſe ſuſpect it ſhould have been <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 62. But thirdly, I anſwer, that in none of all theſe teſtimonies ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, is there any mention of the Roman Church, of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of Councils ſwearing ſubjection to him, but of the Catholick Church in general; ſo that whatever be of theſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150121:37"/>
they make nothing for the Papal intereſt; yet, as if all that is ſaid of the Catholick Church ſhould be expounded of the Romiſh Church, here he takes occaſion to ſnarl with a Cynical ſpite at me, becauſe in my <hi>Paper</hi> 3. againſt Jeſuit <hi>Demſter,</hi> I had made mention of an eminent perſon, who conſidering the ſuperciliouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> did break forth into theſe words, <hi>Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtum iſtius Eccleſiae.</hi> Now I only ask, whether he will deal at this rate with <hi>Baſil</hi> the Great, who <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 10. hath a ſharp reflection upon <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the pride of the Weſtern or Romiſh Church. But fourthly, not to trifle time in a particular examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe teſtimonies, which have been ſo often canvaſed by our Controverſie-Writers, and divers of them lately by <hi>M. Tombs, loc. cit.</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus, Origen, Cyprian,</hi> to which the reſt ſeem on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter homogeneous (except it be that of <hi>Auſtin, Epiſt.</hi> 118. which ſpeaks of the power of the Church, in reference to things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and ſo concerns not the matter in hand) I anſwer to them all in <hi>cumulo,</hi> that they are wholly impertinent to the preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, for none of them ſpeak of an infallible viſible Judge; far leſs aſſert the neceſſity thereof, ſome of them ſpeak of the perpetuity and indefectibility of the Church, that ſhe cannot be overthrown, and ceaſe to be, as <hi>Ambroſe, Chryſoſt. Euſebius;</hi> the reſt hold forth, that there is a <hi>depoſitum</hi> of truth intruſted to the Church<hi>:</hi> So that their utmoſt ſignificancy, is to teſtifie that God will preſerve in his Church Divine Truths, which are neceſſary to Salvation, and that the whole Catholick Church ſhall never be adulterated with Hereſie, or periſh, which Proteſtants do freely grant. And ſo none of theſe teſtimonies do touch the queſtion in hand; for the queſtion is not, whether the whole Catholick Church may forſake truths neceſſary to Salvation, but whether there ſhall always be a viſible Judge with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over the whole Catholick Church, who cannot err in the leaſt Doctrinal deciſion, of which there is nothing in any of theſe teſtimonies. This is ſo evidently the meaning of them, that the Pamphleter did foreſee, <hi>pag.</hi> 41. <hi>it would be replied to him, that they were to be underſtood of the Church in its diffuſive capacity;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, without once attempting to prove that they were otherwiſe to be taken, he proceeds <hi>pag.</hi> 42. and 43. to another <hi>heap of Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> which he emendicates, for moſt part, from <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de concil. cap.</hi> 3. and they ſeem indeed to ſpeak of the Repreſentatives of the Church, and ſo appear to come nearer to the caſe in hand. But before I come to examine them, I muſt, in the fifth place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150121:37"/>
the Pamphleters Argument from this firſt heap of teſtimonies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Romiſh Church, thus; the true Catholick Church is never adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated with Hereſie, nor does depart from the great Truths once delivered to the Saints, ſay theſe teſtimonies of Fathers; but the Romiſh Church hath departed manifeſtly from the Ancient Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Saints, as appears by her groſs Innovations, ſuch as her Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, Half Communion, Invocation, and Worſhipping of Saints deceaſed, and Angels, Relicks, Images, Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, performing the worſhip of God in an unknown Tongue, and the reſt of her Errours and abuſes, manifeſtly repugnant to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Faith of the Primitive Church, as hereafter may be particularly cleared; <hi>ergo,</hi> the Roman is not the true Catholick Church, conſequently theſe teſtimonies are ſo far from advantaging him, that they cut the throat of his own Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>His next bundle of teſtimonies, <hi>pag.</hi> 42, 43. do indeed ſpeak of Councils, but make nothing for the neceſſity of an infallible viſible Judge, as is largely demonſtrated by <hi>Whittaker, de concil. q.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Davenant de Jud. controv. cap.</hi> 19. and <hi>Spalat. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>de Repub. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſs. cap.</hi> 3. I ſhall give but a few brief Animadverſions concerning them. And firſt, this bundle of teſtimonies ſpeaks only of Councils, and conſequently not of an infallible viſible Judge, without which the Church cannot ſubſiſt, there having been whole Ages without Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils. Secondly, I ſhall not ſtand now to accuſe the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter of miſ-citations, though the teſtimony which he aſcribes to <hi>Baſil</hi> is not to be found in <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 10. nor that he gives to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> in <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 64. And though there be not a tenth Book of <hi>Cyril de Trinitate,</hi> unleſs it be meant of his other work entituled <hi>Theſaurus,</hi> if either <hi>Poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> in <hi>apparatu,</hi> or <hi>Bell. de Scriptoribus Eccleſ.</hi> give a right account of his works, Yea, the whole Treatiſe <hi>de Trin.</hi> is concluded ſuppoſititious by <hi>Bell. de Script. Eccleſ.</hi> yet I confeſs <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>de concil. cap.</hi> 3. would be making uſe of the ſame teſtimony from <hi>Cyril,</hi> (for it is uſual with the Cardinal to make a Muſter of Teſtimonies, which himſelf knew to be ſpurious) but he cites it not as this Pamphleter, from <hi>lib.</hi> 10. but from <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Trin.</hi> All I ſay of ſuch eſcapes is, that he would take better heed the next time that he tranſcribes his cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> But I cannot let him paſs with another more egregious prevarication; for what <hi>Leo, Epiphanius, Athanaſius, Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Cyril</hi> ſpake particularly of the Decrees of the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> Councils againſt <hi>Neſtorians, Arrians,</hi> and <hi>Eutychians,</hi> the Pamphleter cites as ſpoken of all Councils. We
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150121:38"/>
grant the firſt four General Councils of <hi>Nice, Conſtantinople, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> did <hi>de facto</hi> define faithfully, according to the Scriptures; but doth it therefore follow, that all Councils ſhall not only do ſo, but alſo that they cannot do otherwiſe, or are infallible? Thirdly, It's true that <hi>Greg. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 24. ſays, <hi>he honours the firſt four General Councils, as be does the four Evangeliſts:</hi> But it's as true he ſays alſo, he honours likewiſe the fifth General Council, which condemned Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> as an Heretick<hi>:</hi> if therefore <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Authority be Authentick, the Jeſuited party is deceived, who make the Papal Chair the Seat of Infallibility. He might alſo have remembred, that <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de eoncil. cap.</hi> 12. confeſſes, that the forecited teſtimony of <hi>Greg.</hi> hath need of a qualification; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſays that <hi>Gregories ſicut,</hi> is a note of ſimilitude, not of equality; otherwiſe the Cardinal cannot deny but <hi>Greg.</hi> over reached. By this ſtill the impertinency of the titation is obvious, for it amounts to this, <hi>Greg.</hi> ſaid the firſt four General Councils defined Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxly; <hi>ergo,</hi> all Councils are infallible. Such is the ludibrious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequence of what he objects, <hi>concerning the eſteem which</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine <hi>bad of the Nicene Council.</hi> Is this the queſtion betwixt us and Romaniſts, whether the Decrees of the Nicene Council againſt <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> were Orthodox? Fourthly, <hi>Auſtin</hi> indeed, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 162. <hi>calls the Sentence of an Oecumenick Council, the laſt Sentence that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected on Earth.</hi> But how inconſequent is it from thence to inferre the infallibility of Councils? Is every Supreme Court infallible? Fifthly, He cites <hi>Vincentius Lyrin Commonit. cap.</hi> 4. (I ſuppoſe he ſhould have ſaid <hi>cap.</hi> 41.) <hi>ſaying, all are to be accounted Hereticks, who do not conform themſelves to the Decrees of Oecumenick Councils.</hi> It were enough to referre him to D. <hi>Barrons Apod. Cathol. tract.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. where at length is demonſtrated, that <hi>Vincentius</hi> maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the infallibility of Councils<hi>:</hi> Nay, <hi>Vincentius cap.</hi> 3. propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes two means for avoiding Hereſie; the one, and the principal, is the Authority of the Sacred Scriptures; the other (which we never diſclaimed in its own place) is the univerſal and perpetual Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Catholick Church; namely, <hi>quod ab omnibus, ubique, &amp; ſemper eſt creditum.</hi> What he ſpeaks <hi>cap.</hi> 41. of conformity with Councils, is not for the deciſion of all controverſies, as himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, nor is it by the ſentence of a preſent living Judge, but of Ancient Councils, and that in ſo far, as they hold out what hath been the Univerſal Tradition of the Church<hi>:</hi> And therefore when they are found incompetent for deciſion of controverſies, <hi>Recurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:150121:38"/>
(ſaith he) <hi>ad Sanctorum Patrum ſententias;</hi> to the unanimous ſuffrage of Fathers, which is far from the Tenet of the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, concerning a preſent living infallible Judge. And though <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> doth magnifie Univerſal Tradition, yet it is without dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from the holy Scriptures; and therefore he ſaith in that place, <hi>cap.</hi> 41. <hi>Non quia Canon ſibi ſolus ad univerſa non ſufficiat,</hi> not that the Canon of Scripture is not of it ſelf alone ſufficient for all things, but only in a ſecondary room, as being explicative of the holy Scriptures. Sixthly, He brings <hi>Auſtin lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de bapt. cont. Don. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>affirming, that no doubt ought to be made of what is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by full Decree of a Council:</hi> But <hi>Auſtin</hi> affirms no ſuch thing, all that <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays is, that there have been various Decrees concerning Rebaptizing in Provincial Councils, <hi>Donec plenario to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius orbis concilio quod ſaluberrime ſentiebatur, etiam remotis dubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus firmaretur;</hi> which imports no more, but that by the Decrees of an Oecumenick Council, truth may be ſo cleared, as to remove all grounds of doubting<hi>:</hi> But it doth not follow, becauſe a Council may clearly define truth, that therefore every Council ſhall infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly define ſo: Nay, on the contrary, <hi>Auſtin</hi> in the ſame <hi>cap.</hi> holds all definitions beſide Scripture to be but humane, <hi>Ne videar</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>humanis agere argumentis—ex Evangelio profero certa docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta; i. e.</hi> leſt I ſhould ſeem to deal with humane arguments,—I bring certain evidences from the Goſpel; and <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that ſubſequent General Councils may correct the Decrees of former Plenary Councils, and that in matters of Faith, as I ſhew before; and therefore he ſuppoſes that General Councils themſelves are fallible. Seventhly, That trivial argument which he uſes, <hi>That the Fathers were wont to ſubſcribe the Canons of General Councils, and annexed</hi> Anathema's <hi>againſt thoſe who did oppoſe them,</hi> concludes no more for the infallibility of General Councils, then of Provincial Synods, the ſame alſo being done in them, yea in Heretical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils alſo<hi>:</hi> it therefore only imports, that they who pronounced <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema</hi>'s, believed that <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> they had defined truly, but not that they judged all Councils, in all their deciſions infallible.</p>
                  <p>That teſtimony of <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, <hi>contra Epiſt. fundi cap</hi> 5. ſo oft object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Romaniſts, is alſo infiſted upon by this Pamphleter; <hi>Ego vero Evangelio non crederem, niſi me Eccleſiae commoveret Authoritas;</hi> Knew not this Pamphleter how oft this teſtimony hath been canva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Proteſtants? Ought he not therefore to have let it alone, or then to have confuted what they have ſaid for cutting off Romiſh
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150121:39"/>
inferences from it? I ſhall ſay but theſe few things thereof; And 1. It might be enough, as to the preſent controverſie, to tell that <hi>Auſtin</hi> does not ſay, except the Authority of a preſent infallible vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Judge did move me. 2. It ſavours of deceit, that the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter has left out the word <hi>Catholicae;</hi> it's the Catholick Church <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of, not the <hi>Roman.</hi> But I muſt in part excuſe the Pamphleter, for he found it alſo ſo mutilated in <hi>H. T's Manual loc. cit.</hi> 3. Have not Popiſh Authors put conſiderable gloſſes on <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s words, which enervate ſufficiently all inferences concerning the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of an infallible viſible Judge? Whether they be expounded with <hi>Gerſon,</hi> of the Apoſtolick Church, <hi>Eorum qui Chriſtum viderunt &amp; audiverunt,</hi> or with <hi>Occam,</hi> of the Univerſal diffuſive Church: Sure they make nothing for an infallible viſible Judge. But fourthly, <hi>Melchior Canus, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>loc. com. cap.</hi> 8. ſeems to have hit on the right meaning of <hi>Auſtin, viz.</hi> that he ſpeaks not of the formal object in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which his belief was reſolved, or of the Primary Rule of Faith, but only of a motive, which when he was a <hi>Manichaean,</hi> firſt indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to credit the Scriptures; and ſo, according to the <hi>African</hi> Dialect, he uſes the <hi>imperfect tenſe</hi> for the <hi>praeterit, commoveret</hi> for <hi>commoviſſet,</hi> which <hi>Rivet</hi> in <hi>Iſagog. cap.</hi> 3. confirms by many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel phraſes out of <hi>Auſtin.</hi> And thus the teſtimony of the Church has but a place among the motives of credibility, which Proteſtants do not deny. This is the more probable, becauſe <hi>Auſtin tract.</hi> 15. in <hi>Joh.</hi> compares the teſtimony of the Church to the teſtimony of the Woman of <hi>Samaria:</hi> But ſure it is, her teſtimony was but an introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive mean to the Faith of her Fellow-Citizens, not the formal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or principal ground thereof. Hence, ſaid they, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 42. <hi>Now we believe not for thy Saying, but becauſe we have heard him our ſelves.</hi> 5. Not to add more, Learned <hi>Calovius de Author. Script. Sect.</hi> 36. hath obſerved a various Lection in that place of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that an old Copy, printed at <hi>Baſil</hi> by the care of <hi>John Amberbachius,</hi> reads it thus<hi>: Niſi Eccleſiae Catholicae Authoritas me commoncret.</hi> It was very eaſie for inadvertent Scribes to turn <hi>n</hi> to <hi>v:</hi> And this read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing does yet further confirm that Expoſition of <hi>Rivet, Melchior Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and others, as if the teſtimony of the Church were <hi>Commoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium quoddam, non principium fidei,</hi> a certain Commonitory, not the principle or ultimate ground of Faith. What is ſaid of this place, may alſo ſufficiently vindicate that other parallel teſtimony of <hi>Auſtins</hi> in that ſame Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. where there be three things which confirm the Expoſition given; one is, that <hi>Auſtin</hi> uſes the <hi>praeter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>

And thirdly, He clearly holds forth that the Church, of whoſe Authority he there ſpeaks, is not to be reſtricted to any viſible Judge, but to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Body of ſound Chriſtians; and therefore calls it <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicorum Authoritatem.</hi> This is yet further evident from <hi>cap.</hi> 3. that he dreamed not of any infallible Authority in the preſent Church, for there he gives an account of his being in the Catholick Church, <hi>from the conſent of People and Nations, from that Authority which was begun by Miracles, nouriſhed by Hope, encreaſed by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and confirmed by continuance.</hi> Sure then he reſolved not his Faith into the infallible teſtimony of the preſent Church.

                  <p>To ſhut therefore up this diſcourſe, I cannot but notice that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Cheat of Romaniſts, when ever they find any high Elogies of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> theſe they appropriate to their Roman, that is, to their infallible viſible Judge, who, in the ſenſe of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited party, is the <hi>Pope:</hi> However, to decline the <hi>odium,</hi> they ſeem to talk of a Council.

                  <p>Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Romaniſts have confidence to affirm, that the Original Scriptures are corrupted.</hi> So <hi>Gordon</hi> of <hi>Huntly, controv.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8, 9, 11, 12. <hi>Melchior Canus loc. com. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Leo Caſtrius, Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Tirin, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, this Pamphleter <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. makes it a great part of his work to prove, that the Scriptures are corrupted, both in the Originals, and in the Tranſlations. Is not this to accuſe the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, as ſuffering the Scriptures, which he had given to lead us to Salvation, to be corrupted? Is it not to charge the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church of unfaithfulneſs, that ſhe was not more careful of ſo rich a <hi>depoſitum?</hi> How deſperate muſt the cauſe of their infallible Judge be, when his Infallibility cannot be maintained, unleſs the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures be diſcredited as corrupt, the Catholick Church accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of unfaithfulneſs, and God robbed of the praiſes due to him for preſerving the Scriptures?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Neither is it a ſmall indignity to the Scriptures, <hi>that they prefer the muddy ſtream of the Vulgar Latine, before the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the Old and New Teſtament.</hi> Yet that Latine Verſion was not made by a perſon acted by a Prophetical and infallible Spirit.

Fifthly, Romaniſts <hi>accuſe the Scripture of Imperfection, as not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all the material Objects of Faith.</hi> So <hi>Eckrius</hi> in <hi>Enchirid. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Coſter</hi> in <hi>Enchirid. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de verb.

                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Romaniſts <hi>accuſe the Scriptures in their greateſt purity, with ſuch obſcurity, ambiguity, and multitude of deſperate ſenſes, that they cannot inſtruct us in the way of Salvation, but as they are ſenſed by the Romiſh infallible Judge.</hi> Hence are many of thoſe ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expreſſions, which <hi>Coſter, Melchior Canus, Pighius,</hi> and others, belch out againſt the Scripture, as ſuffering themſelves to be wire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn by any interpretation. <hi>Greg. de Valen. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Analyſ. fidei, cap.</hi> 2. is bold to ſay that the collation of Scriptures is ſo far from terminating Controverſies, <hi>ut magis augeat,</hi> that it rather encreaſes them<hi>:</hi> Yea, D. <hi>Beard</hi> relates of <hi>Pelargus</hi> the Jeſuit, <hi>that we read in Scripture that an Aſs did ſpeak, but never that the Scripture it ſelf ſpeaks:</hi> So that this Romaniſt makes the Scriptures more mute than <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs; than which (as ſaith the Doctor) what could be bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more like the Beaſt he ſpake of.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>They prohibit the Verſion of the Scriptures into Vulgar Languages, and the people to read the Scripture.</hi> Hence Cardinal <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de inſtruct.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:150121:44"/>
but according to M. <hi>Whyt,</hi> and his Complices, into the Oral teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the preſent Church. Sixthly and laſtly, <hi>Gordon</hi> of <hi>Huntly</hi> in <hi>Epitome controv. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>controv.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. makes the Rule of Faith to be the definition of the preſent Church, which, ſays he, gives not only teſtimony, but Authority to the Scriptures, and this appeareth to be the mind of this Pamphleter: For <hi>pag.</hi> 75. he ſays, <hi>When Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions ariſe concerning Scriptures, the Doctrine of Fathers, yea and Traditions themſelves, then all is to be reſolved into the definition of the preſent Church;</hi> that is ſurely, into the ſentence of their infallible vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Judge: By all which it may appear, Romaniſts have no certain Rule of Faith, they being ſo divided about it. But though, like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Foxes, they look contrary ways, yet they agree generally againſt us (unleſs you except thoſe Ancient School-men) to aſſert, that Scripture is not the principal and compleat Rule of Faith. In this Negative, <hi>Quakers</hi> (who make their Enthuſiaſms, and Light within, to be the Rule of Faith) do joyn with Romaniſts in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to us.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable, that though ſome diverſity may be found in the writings of Reformed Divines in expounding the formal object of Faith, yet ſo far as I have hitherto learned, they are all agreed in the great Point now under debate, viz. <hi>That the Scripture is the principal and compleat Rule of Faith.</hi> For they who hold, as do the moſt, the formal object of Faith to be a compound of the Veracity of God, and of Divine Revelation, do accordingly affirm Scriptural Revelation to be the principal and adequate meaſure, or Rule, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which we are to judge of all material objects or Articles of Faith<hi>:</hi> They likewiſe who conceive the formal object of Faith, ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and entirely to conſiſt in the Veracity of God alone, as doth Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Judicious M. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the Preface to <hi>Part.</hi> 2. of his <hi>Saints Reſt,</hi> do yet acknowledge <hi>that Scriptural Revelation is the principal mean by which the Veracity of God is applied to all the material objects, or particular Articles of Faith;</hi> and conſequently, by them alſo the Scripture is held to be the chief and compleat Standard, Meaſure, or Rule, by which all Articles of Faith are to be judged. In this ſurely M. <hi>Chillingworth, Richard Hooker, Richard Baxter, &amp;c.</hi> agree with other Proteſtant Authors. The difference betwixt theſe Divines, as to this, appears reducible to that School-queſtion, whether Divine Revelation be a part of the formal object of Faith, or only a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requiſite, that we may upon the Veracity of God believe the material objects or particular Articles of Faith. There be great
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:150121:44"/>
School-men for both theſe Opinions, without cenſure of Hereſie on either hand, as may be ſeen in <hi>Carleton Theol. Schol. Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>diſp.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. Would Romaniſts therefore grant, that Scriptural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation is the principal mean by which the Veracity of God is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to all the material objects of Faith, ſo as this were the Standard by which we are to judge of all Articles of Faith. I ſhould not much contend with them, whether they looked on Scriptural Revelation as a part of the formal object of Faith, or only as a requiſite condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our believing upon the Veracity of God; but how far they are from this, may appear by the account I have given of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in the foregoing <hi>Paragraph;</hi> it not being my concern, at the time, to debate that Queſtion of the formal object of Faith, I ſhall abſtract from it, and keep cloſe to this, <hi>of the Rule of Faith;</hi> in which all Reformed Divines are agreed againſt Papiſts and Quakers, that Scripture is the principal, compleat, and infallible Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not dilate upon Arguments to confirm the Orthodox Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this hath been done copiouſly by <hi>Whittaker</hi> againſt <hi>Stapleton, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Author.

So fearful are Romaniſts of theſe diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Teſts, that ſometimes they ſpare not to ſay, as <hi>Melchior Canus, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. that though all the Fathers with one mouth own a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, yet the contrary may be piouſly defended; and of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the <hi>Fratres Valenburgii in examin. princip. examin.</hi> 3. <hi>Num.</hi> 64. affirm, <hi>ut Traditio aliqua ſit Apoſtolica nihil detrimenti eam accipere, licet aliquando in Eccleſia de ea dubitatum ſit;</hi> yea this Pamphleter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, <hi>pag.</hi> 75. <hi>that ſuch doubts may be moved concerning Fathers and Traditions, that at length all muſt be reſolved into the definition of the preſent viſible Judge.</hi> My work therefore ſhall be to hold out the Scripture to be the principal and compleat Rule of Faith, whereby it will appear that other pretended Rules, either are not true Rules, or but ſubordinate to the Scriptures.</p>

If Romaniſts run to their old Evaſion, that what is wanting in the Scripture, is ſupplied by the Church, they are readily confuted, for then the Scripture were not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:150121:47"/>
able to make us wiſe to ſalvation, but the Church by other mean, ſhould do it: If the Church have truths not contained in Scripture, either they are more ſublime than theſe in Scripture, or not: Not more ſublime<hi>:</hi> Are there more ſublime Myſteries of Chriſtianity than the Myſteries of the Trinity, Incarnation, Reſurrection, all which are undoubtedly in Scripture. If then they be but inferiour Truths, ſeeing God committed the moſt ſublime Myſteries to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, how kept he up thoſe inferiour Truths? But whence hath the Church the knowledge of thoſe Myſteries not contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? if they ſay from Oral Tradition, then Oral Tradition ſhould rather be the Rule of Faith, than the ſentence of the infallible Judge, which, I doubt, if the Jeſuited party will admit, I appeal to all the Romaniſts in the world, to inſtance one Article of Faith conveyed down by Univerſal Tradition, and not contained in the Scripture? Is there any dogmatical Controverſie betwixt Romaniſts and us, for which they pretend not Scripture? Is not this a practical teſtimony to the fulneſs of Scripture, as comprehending all material objects of Faith, which at other times they diſpute againſt?</p>
                  <p>The chief difficulty that here can be moved is, <hi>that Scripture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove its own Original to be Divine, or define the number of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Books.</hi> Not to inſiſt upon many things which may be replied, this alone, at this time, may ſuffice, that though what is objected were true, yet Scripture would not ceaſe to be the Rule of Faith; it being ſufficient, that the Rule of Faith doth determine all queſtions about the material objects of Faith; whereas the Books of holy Scripture are either a part of the formal object of Faith, or at leaſt a condition belonging thereto; or to ſpeak more plainly, they are the Rule of Faith it ſelf: Nay, this is ſuch a Pedantick Sophiſm, as if to uſe M. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s example in his ſafe way to ſalvation, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 27. When a Merchant ſhewing his own ſhip, containing all his ſtock, ſays all his ſubſtance is in ſuch a ſhip, one ſhould infer, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſhip were no part of his ſubſtance, or that the ſhip were in her ſelf; whereas the Merchants expreſſion imports no more, but that all his goods diſtinct from the ſhip were contained therein. So if Scripture be able to determine all queſtions of Religion, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the material objects of Faith, though thoſe, which relate to its being the Rule, receive Evidence another way, it loſes nothing of this property of the Rule of Faith. And to ſhew that Romaniſts are no leſs concerned in this objection than we, I ask if they can aſſign any Rule of Faith that can reſolve all queſtions which may be moved
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:150121:47"/>
concerning it ſelf; as whether Oral Tradition, or the definition of the viſible Judge be the Rule; or which ſoever of theſe be pitched upon, can it prove its own infallibility? can it reſolve what Articles of Faith are only to be learned by unwritten Tradition, and not at all by Scripture, or who is the ſubject of Infallibility, whether the Pope or Council, or both conjunctly? Is it not like that before, they produce a Rule of Faith to reſolve theſe and ſuch like queſtions, they will betake themſelves to our Anſwer, that it's not requiſite that the queſtions which concern the being of the Rule of Faith, be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Rule it ſelf, only I muſt mind them, that theſe things muſt at leaſt have evidence from ſome other head, which I doubt will hardly be found, concerning the queſtions laſt mentioned<hi>:</hi> But the queſtions which they move to us concerning the Divine Original of the Scriptures, and the number of Canonick Books, receive a clear determination, partly from the motives of Credibility, as Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts themſelves confeſs, concerning all the Books which we hold as Canonical. The like cannot be ſaid of their <hi>Apocrypha</hi> Books, as ſhall appear <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. and <hi>Append.</hi> 1. to <hi>cap.</hi> 7. and partly by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Characters of a Divine Original, for thoſe are inherent to all the Books of Scripture, and to no other writing, conſequently thoſe give evidence of their Divine Extract, though not by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal teſtimony. I ſhall not here inſiſt upon the reflex teſtimony which Scripture gives to its own Divine Original, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>All Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is given by inſpiration of God,</hi> or of the ground which is given, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. to diſprove the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> Books as no part of the ſacred Canon of the Old Teſtament, in as much as the Scripture of the Old Teſtament was delivered to the Jewiſh Church, which certainly never owned the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> Books as part of the Scriptures, as is clear from <hi>Joſephus, lib.</hi> 1. againſt <hi>Appion.</hi> Yet becauſe we muſt firſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Divine Original of thoſe teſtimonies, before we argue from them; therefore I reſt on what I have ſaid: What need I more, ſo full are the Scriptures, that <hi>Baſil Serm. de vera fide,</hi> concludes it a manifeſt falling from the Faith, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Doth the Authority of the Scriptures depend upon any</hi> prior <hi>Rule;</hi> if there were any, ſhould it not be either Tradition, or the definition of the Church not Tradition? The moſt that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> dared to ſay for Traditions, was to equal them
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150121:48"/>
with the Scripture, to be received <hi>pari pietatis affectu;</hi> but if they were a Prior Rule, upon whoſe Authority the Authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did depend, they ſhould be preferred to the Scripture. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Tradition to have a chief place among the motives of Credibility, preparing us to believe the Scripture; Tradition, I ſay, not of the Church only, but alſo of Infidels<hi>:</hi> Yea, the teſtimony of Infidels, in this caſe, may perhaps be more convincing than the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Church, for Enemies cannot be ſuppoſed to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by intereſt, to give teſtimony againſt their own ſelves<hi>:</hi> Nor will, I hope, Romaniſts be ſo impudent, as to ſay, that the teſtimony of Infidels is the Rule of Faith? If Tradition of the Church were to be the Rule, either it muſt be the Tradition of the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Reduplication, as being the Church, or as the Tradition and teſtimony of ſuch prudent men<hi>:</hi> Not the firſt; for the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known as a Church, but by the proper notes of the Church; and theſe cannot be had, but by the Rule of Faith, this being a part of our Faith, that theſe are the proper notes of the true Church, and conſequently I muſt firſt know the Rule of Faith, before I know the Church under the reduplication of a Church. This, I ſuppoſe, will be found to be demonſtratively concluſive: If therefore the Tradition of the Church only, as the teſtimony of prudent men, be ſaid to be the Rule, a meerly humane thing ſhould be the principal Rule of the Chriſtian Faith and Religion, which I believe no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, unleſs he be of a <hi>Socinian</hi> impreſſion, will admit. I confeſs the concurring teſtimony, and Tradition of ſo many prudent men, who cannot be ſuppoſed to have colluded together upon any baſe deſign to cheat the World, may be ſo far convincing, as to ſhew that there is no rational ground of doubting the Divine Original of the Scriptures, and ſo may remove thoſe prejudices which might have impeded our diſcovery of thoſe intrinſick Rays of Majeſty reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the holy Scriptures, which are the chief Evidence of their Divine Original. But beſides, giving, and not granting, that our aſſent to the Divine Original of the Scriptures were only founded upon the Churches Tradition, yet it doth not follow, that the Churches Tradition ſhould be the principal Rule of Faith: Which I illuſtrate by two examples. It's granted by all, that the Veracity of God is the formal object of Faith, if not in whole, yet in part; but the firſt aſſent that is given to the Veracity of God, is ſurely found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Natural Reaſon<hi>:</hi> Yet School men themſelves will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that thoſe Natural Reaſons, which prove the Veracity of God,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:150121:48"/>
are the formal object of Faith, as may be ſeen in <hi>Lugo de fide, diſp.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. and <hi>Carleton, Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>Theol. Schol. diſp.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. Who would be further ſatisfied how Natural Reaſon is not the Rule of Faith and Religion, albeit Religion and Faith do preſuppoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I muſt remit them to the Debates of our Divines againſt <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and to thoſe betwixt the Paradoxal Author of <hi>Philoſophia Scripturae Interpres,</hi> and <hi>Vogelſangius, &amp;c.</hi> Only now I conclude <hi>à pari,</hi> though Tradition alone ſhould prove the Divine Original of the Scriptures, yet would it not neceſſarily follow, that Tradition were the principal Rule of Faith. I add another example, ſuppoſe the King ſent a Letter to his Subjects, containing his pleaſure, as to ſundry particulars of moment, although the teſtimony of a Truſty Bearer might give Evidence, that the Letter were truly the Kings, yet would it be the Kings Letter, and not the Bearers teſtimony, that would be the rule of the Subjects obedience. The Applica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ion is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. The ſame reaſons demonſtrate, that neither can the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church be the firſt Rule of Faith, for we muſt know the Rule of Faith, before we know the Church as a Church, it being by the Rule of Faith that we have the knowledge of the notes of the Church. Nay further, the Church is built upon the Foundation of Prophets and Apoſtles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. that is, upon the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament<hi>:</hi> for as <hi>Eſthius</hi> well obſerves, Prophets and Apoſtles are ſaid to be the Foundation of the Church, <hi>ratione Doctrinae,</hi> inreſpect of their Doctrine, but the Doctrine of the old Prophets was only preſerved entirely and incorruptly in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for that the Traditions of thoſe times were vitiated, Chriſt witneſſes oftner than once. Shall the Law of the moſt High God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Authority from his Creatures? Did <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he received the Law from the mouth of the Lord, wait for the ſuffrages of the Church, or their Repreſentatives, to make it Authentick? Whence have we the knowledge of the infallible and reciprocal notes of the Church, but from the Scripture? Then, ſurely, the belief of the Scripture muſt be preſuppoſed to the diſtinct knowledge of the true Church; conſequently our Faith cannot ultimately be reſolved into the definitions of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, Is not the Scripture <hi>a publick Standard of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth, whereby the Church may convince Gain-ſayers?</hi> Doth not the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. ſay, that the Scripture is profitable for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, <gap reason="foreign">

Theſe things being ſo clear, I will now examine the Objections of the Pamphleter, which if they conclude any thing, make as ſtrongly againſt themſelves, or any Rule of Faith they can pretend to, yea ſerve as well to prove that the Scriptures are no ground of Faith at all, as that they are not a ground of the Religion of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.

I anſwer firſt by retortion. This Objection militates as ſtrongly againſt Romaniſts, as againſt us: For after the ſame manner it may be enquired, whether the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Church, or infallible viſible Judge, namely, the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:150121:50"/>
of Popes, and Canons of Councils, be the ground of their Faith and Religion in the Languages wherein they were firſt given out, <hi>viz.</hi> in Greek, or Latin, or as Tranſlated? Not as Tranſlated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Tranſlations are not Authentical, but in ſo far as they agree with the Principals, and the Principals by many are not underſtood<hi>:</hi> But beſides, what aſſurance can they have that thoſe Originals are not corrupted in the conveyance by fallible men? Have not Learned Criticks diſcovered, that many ſuppoſititious Decretals, and Canons of Councils, are obtruded on the Chriſtian world by Romaniſts? Hath not <hi>Iſidore Clarius,</hi> a Popiſh Writer, noted as many Errours in the Vulgar Latin Verſion, as any of thoſe, mentioned in the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, have alledged in the Verſions of Proteſtants? conſequently Romaniſts themſelves muſt confeſs this Argument of the Pamphleter to be a Sophiſm, ſeeing it overturns alſo the ground of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<hi>:</hi> Nay, the ſame Cavil might have been moved againſt the Ancient Chriſtian Church, for in her alſo there were many who underſtood not the Hebrew Text; yea, ſome of the Fathers had little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of that Language; then alſo there were innumerable Latin Tranſlations, made by fallible perſons, witneſs <hi>Auſtin, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de doct.

                  <p>Secondly, Therefore leaving retorſion, I anſwer abſolutely, that Scripture, both in the Originals, and when faithfully tranſlated, is the Rule of Faith. If an Ambaſſadour deliver his mind by an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, are not the words of the Interpreter the words of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour? Was not the Faith of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> built upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Prophets and Apoſtles? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. But it cannot be ſuppoſed with any probability, that all the <hi>Epheſians</hi> did underſtand
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150121:50"/>
the Originals of the Prophets writings, for they were not Jews; therefore ſurely their Faith has been built on tranſlated Scripture<hi>:</hi> Neither can Chriſts Command of ſearching the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39. be reſtricted to the Originals only, ſeeing himſelf, and the Apoſtles, did frequently cite the Scriptures according to the Verſion of the 70. Neither ſay <hi>Chamier, Featly,</hi> or D. <hi>Barron,</hi> any thing contrary to this, for they only deny Verſions to be the Rule of Faith, in ſo far as they diſagree from the Originals; yea, then to ſpeak properly, they are not Tranſlations at all<hi>:</hi> I notice not much the wrong Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Chamier,</hi> in whoſe <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. there is not a <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. for the Pamphleter ſhews himſelf to be as implicite in his Citations, as in his Faith.</p>
                  <p>Only it may be replied, <hi>How can illiterate perſons reſolve their Faith upon a tranſlated Bible, ſeeing they cannot examine its conformity or diſconformity with the Original, they being ignorant of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage?</hi> But it may as eaſily be retorted, How can an illiterate man reſolve his Faith upon the definition of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Doway</hi> or <hi>Rhemiſt</hi> Tranſlations, or upon a Bull or Decretal of the Pope, ſeeing he cannot examine if theſe be faithfully tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from rhe Latin? What anſwer Romaniſts give, we can give the ſame. Had not the Pamphleter been diſpoſed to quarrel, he might have found this difficulty copiouſly cleared in that <hi>Cap.</hi> of D. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons Apodex.</hi> which himſelf cited, <hi>viz. tract.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>cap.</hi> 2. Shortly then, for ſatisfaction of the Reader, I anſwer, that a perſon unskilled in the Original Language, may not only have a humane moral certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the conformity of his Engliſh Bible with the Original, upon the teſtimony of a Proteſtant Church, and Learned Paſtors, but alſo as <hi>Camero</hi> in his excellent <hi>tractat. de notis quibus verbum Dei in ſpecie dignoſcitur Not.</hi> 3. obſerves, there is a ſpecial Divine Character in the Scriptures, which is not to be reſtricted to the Original Languages, but individually inherent to the Doctrine of Scripture in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Language, if it be faithfully tranſlated, which the Author doth there copiouſly illuſtrate. Among other things, he uſes this example, <hi>pag.</hi> 32. Some of <hi>Averroes</hi> writings are tranſlated into ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry barbarous Latin, yet there is no judicious Reader (ſaith he) but will diſcern <hi>Averroes</hi> to have been a moſt Eloquent man, the Tropes, Figures, and Metaphors, being kept in the Verſion. He compares a faithful Tranſlation to a Picture drawn with Ink, by which we may diſcern the lineaments and comelineſs of the perſon repreſented thereby, though not the colour. So albeit there be ſome things acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150121:51"/>
in the Original Language which a Tranſlation cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ſtill there is as much as may manifeſt the Divine Original of the Scriptures. For further ſatisfaction in this thing, I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the ſincere Lover of Truth, the peruſal both of that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of <hi>Camero,</hi> and of an excellent little Treatiſe of D. <hi>Owen,</hi> of the Divine Original, Authority, and ſelf-evidencing light and power of the Scriptures. Neither ought it ſeem ſtrange to any, that there ſhould be ſuch a ſelf-evidencing light in the Doctrines of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation contained in holy Scripture, yea, there is a kind of neceſſity it muſt be ſo, conſidering the poſture of humane affairs. For ſeeing the World is divided into ſo many various Languages, whether the Lord thought fit to reveal the Doctrine of ſalvation by a written In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, ſuch as the Scriptures, or by the definition of a viſible Judge, as Papiſts pretend, yet it behoved to be delivered in ſome one Language; and ſeeing thoſe Truths were, by the confeſſion of both Parties, to be conveyed to others of different Languages, by the means of fallible perſons, either there behoved to be an intrinfick e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the Doctrine, to ſhew that it came from God, which we affirm, or the moſt part of the world ſhould only have a moral and humane certainty of thoſe Myſteries of ſalvation, which the plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, both of Papiſts and Proteſtants, do judge inſufficient to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It's no Phanatical Enthuſiaſm therefore to ſay, that ſouls en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the Spirit of God, without the knowledge of Greek or Hebrew Languages, in a faithfully tranſlated Bible, may ſee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Gods Law.

an admirable ſweet condiſcention in the Scriptures?

                  <p>If this do not ſatisfie pertinacious Romaniſts, they may at laſt conſider what their Learned Cardinal <hi>de Lugo</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>diſp.</hi> 1. <hi>de fide Sect.</hi> 7, 8. where he maintains, at length, againſt his Fellow-Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, that the firſt aſſent given by Chriſtians to Scriptural Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is immediate, and not founded upon any Prior objective ground. Indeed he calls it obſcure and inevident, but withal infallible, moſt certain, and immediate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, he particularly denies it to be founded on the teſtimony of the Church, Miracles, or conſtancy of Martyrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only he affirms, that a man comparing Scriptural Revelation accompanied with ſuch Miracles, the death of Martyrs, the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of ſo many judicious Doctors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the Idea which he hath in his mind of a Divine Revelation, finds ſuch a conſonancy betwixt them, that without any diſcurſive inference, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately aſſents to that Revelation as Divine; which the ſaid Author illuſtrates by this ſimilitude, as when, ſaith he, a man receives a Letter from his Friend, or hears him ſpeak at a diſtance, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the Characters of the Letter, and the Voice which he hears, with the Idea which he hath in his mind of his Friends Writing or Voice; and ſo, without any argumentation, concludes this is his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:150121:52"/>
Friends Writ, or Voice, and ſuch he ſuppoſes to be our firſt aſſent to Divine Revelation. This Notion of the Cardinal, for which he diſputes with much Learning and acuteneſs, quite overturns the whimſies of the Pamphleting Miſſionaries, who would have the firſt aſſent to Scriptural Revelation, to be grounded on the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church, or definition of their infallible Judge.</p>
                  <p>As for the Clamours of the Adverſary, <hi>that the Proteſtants men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Objection, have charged the Tranſlations of one another with Errours and Diſcrepancies.</hi> Ought he not to remember, that there be as great variety and contrariety betwixt the Verſions made by Popiſh Authors, ſuch as <hi>Lyranus Paulus Brugenſis, Valla, Cajetan, Eraſmus, Pagnin, Arriat, Montanus, &amp;c.</hi> Had thoſe imagined a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the Vulgar Latin, would they have diſſented from it ſo often? Do not <hi>Vega, Andradius, Driedo, Mariana</hi> affirm, that the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> when it declared the Vulgar Latin to be Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Scripture, never intended to aſſert its freedom from Errour? Doth not <hi>Iſidore Clarius,</hi> a Popiſh Biſhop aver, that he has amended 8000 places in the Vulgar Latin, and yet left many to be correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yea, ſo many were the Errours of the <hi>Clementine</hi> Tranſlation, that one ſpared not to call it the <hi>New Tranſgreſſion.</hi>

The Cenſure of <hi>Carolus Molinoeus</hi> is not much to be regarded, he being no Divine, but an unſetled, though Learned Lawyer; firſt a Papiſt, then a Proteſtant, and afterwards with the Dog returning to his Vomit, and re<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>imbracing Popery, he breathed forth invectives againſt worthy men, as is uſual with Apoſtates to be haters of their own Sect.

It's not denied, but the firſt may be incident to any Verſion made by humane induſtry: but I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal all the Romiſh Party, to try if they can charge the Engliſh Tranſlation, which is made uſe of in this Church, with any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Errour and Article of Faith; that had been the moſt ſolid way of arguing againſt us. As for <hi>the diverſities betwixt the Engliſh Tranſlation under Q.</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and K.</hi> James 6. I ſuppoſe it will be found, that both the reading laid aſide, and that which is ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are conform to the Analogy of Faith, though the one may be more agreeable to the Original and Series of the Context, and ſo is preferrable to the other; by which the ingenuity of Proteſtant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may appear, they being willing to correct the leaſt failure.

It were eaſie to demonſtrate, that the Papiſts vulgar Verſion is often guilty of ill Latin, and worſe Divinity: Who deſire an account of the varieties, contradictions, errours, and barbariſms of the Vulgar Latin, I refer them to D. <hi>James bellum Papale, Calov.

But this is the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of <hi>Rome</hi>'s pretended Infallibility, that ſhe will rather juſtly know faults<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than by amending them, humbly confeſs her ſelf falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. In a word, except Romaniſts can prove that in our Tranſlations there be ſuch Errours, as deſtroy the ſubſtantials of Chriſtianity, (which though the Conclaves of <hi>Rome</hi> and Hell do joyn forces, cannot be done) it cannot be concluded that our Bibles are not a ſufficient Ground and Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up the Anſwer to this Objection, <hi>Richard Cappell</hi> in his Remains, <hi>pag.</hi> 30, 31. preſents this Notion to the conſideration of the Godly Learned, that ſeeing the Lord hath commanded his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to hear, read and ſearch the Scriptures, which the multitude cannot do but in ſome Tranſlation or other, and God being in his Providence very careful that his Church ſhall not want ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for their Souls, therefore he, the ſaid M. <hi>Cappell,</hi> ſuppoſes, that God ever hath, doth, and will ſo aſſiſt Tranſlators, that, for the main, they ſhall not err.

Hence it is, that in our laſt Tranſlation of the Bible, the word in the Margin is often uſed; yet ſo, as that the word in the Line is alſo noted, where there appears any conſiderable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which the Tranſlators would not have done (as D. <hi>Owen</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly obſerves) had they not conceived, that both the word in the Margin, and in the Line, had an Authoritative Original, beyond the impeachment of any man in theſe days.</p>

But the truth is, whatever were the time wherein thoſe <hi>Rabbins</hi> lived, it is a manifeſt falſhood which this Pamphleter ſays, <hi>that they did put in Vowels into the Text, which made moſt different readings:</hi> For, as is obſerved not only by <hi>Buxtorf Anticrit.

For by the Collection of thoſe various readings of <hi>Ben Aſher,</hi> and <hi>Ben-Naphtali,</hi> it appears how ſtudious, religious, yea and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the Jewiſh Doctors were in obſerving the leaſt varieties which did ſteal into the Copies of the Holy Bible: if therefore there had
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:150121:57"/>
been any material differences, they had undoubtedly been Recorded by them, conſequently thoſe of <hi>Ben-Aſher,</hi> and <hi>Ben-Naphtali,</hi> being rather ſcrupuloſities about Orthography than Orthodoxy, it appears evident they found the Scriptures entire and incorrupt, as to the matter. Thus the Pamphleters Objection has furniſhed us with an Argument againſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>It's fifthly alledged by the Pamphleter, <hi>that the Hebrew Vowels were added to the Text</hi> 500 <hi>years after Chriſt, by his profeſſed Enemies the Jews. Anſwer.</hi> This ſtory, of the late invention of the Hebrew Vowels, is not ſo certain and uncontroverted, that we muſt believe it upon this Pamphleters naked Aſſertion. It is too daring boldneſs in Jeſuits to puſh at the Authority of the holy Scriptures upon meer conjectures, It's true, <hi>Elias Levita,</hi> a Jewiſh Rabbin, and skilled Grammarian, who lived in <hi>Germany</hi> about the time of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, affirmed, that the Hebrew Vowels were invented by ſome Rabbins at <hi>Tiberias,</hi> after the perfecting of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> ſome 500 years after Chriſt. Hereupon <hi>Morinus, Gordon</hi> of <hi>Huntly,</hi> and other Jeſuits, whom this Pamphleter implicitly follows, took occaſion to bark againſt the holy Scriptures, as being corrupted by that Novel Punctation, though in this they go contrary to <hi>Elias,</hi> who affirms, that the <hi>Maſorites</hi> at <hi>Tiberias</hi> in adding the Vowels, adhered faithfully to the true reading of the Scriptures, as they were firſt given out by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets. But this whole ſtory of <hi>Elias Levita</hi> is contradicted by the generality of the Jews, who maintain, that if the Hebrew Vowels were not given by the Lord to <hi>Moſes</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with the Letters, yet at leaſt they were added by <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the men of the great Synagogue, who were infallibly guided by the Spirit of God.

I hear Jeſuit <hi>Con,</hi> with the reſt of our Miſſionaries, has been deviſing a Parentheſis to palliate their ſhameful ignorance<hi>:</hi> But Learned men, no wiſe concerned in this Debate, upon a narrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the place, have obſerved, that the words will not admit ſuch a Parentheſis without manifeſt non-ſenſe: Yet leaſt I ſhould ſeem to injure him, I here exhibit the <hi>formalia verba</hi> of the Pamphleter, <hi>pag.</hi> 55. <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>take in alſo with thoſe, the corruptions of the Greek Text, remarked in part by S.</hi> Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, <hi>and others, ſays</hi> Euſebius, <hi>when the Ancient Hereticks, the Arrians, Macedonians, Neſtorians, &amp;c. had corrupted and adulterated the Word of God to ſupport their Errours.</hi> Let the ingenuous Reader judge, if I have not exhibited the genuine ſenſe of thoſe words; I know not whether to aſcribe it to his ignorance or diſingenuity, <hi>that he charges Proteſtants as taking in, or owning the Arrian, Macedonian, and Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian corruptions of the Bible:</hi> A Calumny ſo far from truth, that to mention it is enough to refute it, it may ſuffice to diſcover the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſo groſs a miſtake.

                     </hi> 12. but had no wit to do it handſomely<hi>:</hi> What Jeſuit <hi>Gordon</hi> had branched forth in divers Arguments againſt the purity of the Greek Text of the New Teſtament, this Pamphleter confuſes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Jeſuit <hi>Gordon</hi> in his firſt Argument ſaid, that <hi>Irenaeus, Tertull.

Now the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter ſeems to have taken thoſe Hereticks, laſt named, to be them of whom <hi>Irenaeus, Tertull.</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> did complain, not conſidering that the Ages in which thoſe Fathers wrote, and wherein thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks did ariſe, would diſcover his Errour. But againſt Jeſuit <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and him, I argue thus; if the Scriptures were corrupted by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks in the days of thoſe Fathers, then continued they not pure unto <hi>Hieroms</hi> time, as <hi>Gordon</hi> the Jeſuit alledges, and conſequently their own Vulgar Latin muſt be corrupted alſo, as taken from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Original.

                  <p>His ſixth allegation is, <hi>that Proteſtants never ſaw the Original Scriptures penned by Prophets, Apoſtles, and Copies are ſubject to faults.</hi> Did never this Scribler reflect that it would be retorted upon him, that they can no more produce the Tranſlators Autograph of the Vulgar Latin, than we of the Originals<hi>:</hi> Neither have they the Autographs of the old Decretals, or of the Ancient Councils, and the Copies of theſe Books are doubtleſs ſubject alſo to faults? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs we pretend not to have the Autographs, nor judge we it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yea, it was naturally impoſſible, that Paper or Parchment could have continued ſo long without corruption. What <hi>Baronius</hi> relates of <hi>Marks</hi> Autographs at <hi>Venice,</hi> may have place among their other Legends, yet <hi>Cornel. à Lapide,</hi> who ſays it is in Greek, confeſſes, that through Antiquity it is become illegible, and conſequently uſeleſs<hi>:</hi> But does it follow, that becauſe we have not the Autographs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Originals are corrupt? if it be ſaid that Tranſcribers are fallible, are not the Tranſcribers of the Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> fallible alſo? if notwithſtanding they bear Faith, ſhall not the Copy of Original Scriptures much more make Faith? Cannot the Providence of God preſerve the Original Scriptures? Will not the fear of God make men more tender and circumſpect in tranſcribing the holy Scriptures, than in tranſcribing other Books? Is not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church engaged to be watchful, leſt the Scriptures of God ſhould be corrupted? If Univerſal Tradition make Faith in any matter, doth it not concerning the <hi>depoſitum</hi> of the Scriptures?</p>
                  <p>His ſeventh and laſt allegation is, <hi>of the various Lections of the New Teſtament, atteſted by the Prefacer to the</hi> Biblia Polyglotta. Should he not firſt have remembred how many various Lections are in the Vulgar Latin, let him compare the Bibles of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> the 8. and read D. <hi>James Bellum Papale,</hi> and men tell if there be not both various Lections and contradictions betwixt them?

Are there not ſpecial helps, in theſe caſes, for finding out the true reading in the New Teſtament, ſuch as the conſideration of the Context, the Analogy of Faith, the more ancient and approved Copies, Citations, and Expoſitions of Fathers, ancient Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, particularly the <hi>Syriack:</hi> Neither do Proteſtants deny but uſe may be made of Latin Verſions, eſpecially of more ancient Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as was done by <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his Annotations, yet not as a Rule, but as a mean to be made uſe of in conjunction with the reſt.

expreſly prohibited, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> be called <hi>Summus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos, princeps Sacerdotum aut aliquid ejuſmodi.</hi> Neither are all the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books included in that 47 <hi>Can.</hi> for neither in the Greek Code, nor in the Collection of Canons made by <hi>Creſconius,</hi> is there mention of the Books of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> neither are the reſt of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal</hi> Books, which are there mentioned, ſpoken of as ſtrictly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical for proving Articles of Faith.

This Pamphleter argues againſt us, as if I ſhould argue thus againſt him, Janſeniſts, whom he holds for Hereticks, appeal to the ſentence of an infallible viſible Judge, as well as Jeſuits; therefore the ſentence of the infallible viſible Judge cannot be the Rule of Faith<hi>:</hi> Or thus, Quakers pretend to an infallible direction of the

ſo is a begging of the queſtion<hi>:</hi> Only to prevent Logomachies and miſtakes about words, it would be conſidered, that the chief que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion betwixt Romaniſts and us in this thing is, concerning the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe of Juſtification; what it is that purchaſes to us Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, and right to Eternal Life.

examine the new notions of ſome late Learned Writers touching this matter, whoſe way ſhould I imbrace, I might perhaps eaſily expede my ſelf from Romiſh Cavils, and leave alſo ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble differences betwixt the Romiſh Party and Proteſtants in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But I confeſs I am afraid of new Methods, eſpecially in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great importance, as the point of Juſtification<hi>:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore holding to the more received grounds, <hi>I</hi> ſhall remit the Reader to Reverend Biſhop <hi>Downam,</hi> his learned Treatiſe of Juſtification, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. where he both diſcuſſes <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> Quibbles, as alſo illuſtrates that place in S. <hi>James,</hi> by an Elegant Analytick Expoſition, from <hi>ver.</hi> 14. to the end of the Chapter. Let it ſuffice at preſent to advertiſe the Reader, that S. <hi>James</hi> uſes neither the word <hi>Faith,</hi> nor the word <hi>Juſtifie,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe with S. <hi>Paul;</hi> nor does he debate the queſtion which S. <hi>Paul</hi> handled, or which is at this day toſſed betwixt Romaniſts and us. For clearing theſe things, briefly <hi>I</hi> ſay firſt, when S. <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>we are not juſtified by Faith only,</hi> he takes not Faith for a ſaving Grace of the Spirit, receiving whole Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. <hi>purifying the heart,</hi> Act. 15. 9. <hi>and working by love, Gal.</hi> 5. 6. which is the only true Faith by which we are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the Doctrine of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches<hi>:</hi> But S. <hi>James</hi> takes Faith for a dogmatical aſſent to Divine Truths, joyned with an outward profeſſion, but ſuch as may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from good works, as is evident from the ſeries of his whole diſcourſe, particularly from <hi>ver.</hi> 14. where the ſtate of the queſtion which S. <hi>James</hi> handles is propounded, <hi>What doth it profit, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, though a man ſay he hath Faith, and have not works?</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Can that Faith ſave him, by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears S. <hi>James</hi> whole diſcourſe is, concerning that Faith which a man ſaith he hath, but may be void of good works<hi>:</hi> Now that is not the Faith, by which we, according to the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, affirm a man to be juſtified without the works of the Law; for true juſtifying Faith, is a living and working Faith. But <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Faith, if it have no works, is dead, being alone. I</hi> add ſecondly, that when S. <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>that a man is juſtified by works,</hi> he does not ſpeak as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> of the true proper Act of Juſtification, which is a Judicial Act of God, really acquitting the ſinner of guiltineſs, and from the wrath of God, to which he was lyable, but of a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtification, or of that which evidences a man to be in a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied eſtate, or to be acquitted from guilt and wrath: Nor needs this ſeem ſtrange to any, it being a Rule among Interpreters of

The chief difficulty which here ſeems to ariſe is, that if the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> did here ſpeak only of a declarative Juſtification, then he would have aſcribed this Juſtification only to good works, and not at all to Faith; whereas the Apoſtle gives good works, and Faith, a conjunct intereſt in the Juſtification where of he treats; <hi>you ſee then, how by Works a man is juſtified, and not by Faith. Anſw.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference would perhaps have ſome ſtrength, had the Apoſtle been ſpeaking only of the internal act of Faith; but not at all, when, as hath been ſhewed, the Faith ſpoken of, is a profeſſed Faith; for the profeſſion of Faith may concur with good works, to declare and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence a perſon to be in a Juſtified Eſtate. Thirdly therefore, and laſtly, for the full illuſtration of this whole matter, we would care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully notice the different queſtions handled by the two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apoſtles, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and S. <hi>James.</hi> The Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> having to do with perſons who Phariſaical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boaſted of their good works, and preſumed, as our Romaniſts do to this day, to be juſtified thereby, or at leaſt joyned their good works, with Faith in Chriſt, as the ground of their Juſtification before God<hi>:</hi> Therefore he diſputes at length the ſame queſtion, which now is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated betwixt Romaniſts and us, what is the true ground upon which a ſinner is accepted of God, and pronounced by him Juſt, as if he had perfectly kept the whole Law in his own perſon; and to hammer down theſe proud Juſtitiaries, he concludes, that the only ground of this Juſtification of a ſinner before God, is the obedience of Chriſt laid hold upon by Faith, and totally ſecludes good works from having any cauſal influence upon Juſtification; which he proves, beſides many other Arguments, by the moſt appoſite examples of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:150121:68"/>
and <hi>David.</hi> For if any could have been juſtified by works, then ſurely <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> perſons of ſo Eminent Holineſs, had been juſtified thereby, but not they, as he ſhews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Ergo,</hi> none at all. But S. <hi>James,</hi> on the other hand, had to do with a kind of Epicures, who abuſing S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith without the works of the Law, maintained there was no neceſſity of good works, but only to profeſs Faith in Chriſt. This is S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s obſerve, and not mine, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. <hi>Jacobus vult corrigere eos qui Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum male intelligendo, nolebant bene operari, de ſola fide praeſumentes.</hi> So that the queſtion which S. <hi>James</hi> agitates is, whether there be a neceſſity of good works; which he reſolves affirmatively, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al atteſts, that though they be not the cauſes of our Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, yet they are the inſeparable effects of a Juſtifying Faith, and the Evidences of a Juſtified Eſtate. For this end he brings in not only the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Rahab,</hi> who of an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del had been proſelyted to the Faith, yet ſhe alſo demonſtrated the ſoundneſs of her Faith, by her works of mercy to the Servants of God. Thus the harmony of theſe two Apoſtles may luculently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews good works have no cauſal influence upon Juſtification; the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> teaches, that though they be not the cauſes, yet they demonſtrate the truth of a Juſtifying Faith: For as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, <hi>lib. de fide &amp; operibus cap.</hi> 14. good works <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur Juſtificatum, non praecedunt Juſtificandum</hi> that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Juſtification, can neither cauſally nor formally juſtifie, but well may evidence a Juſtified Eſtate; and this was all which S. <hi>James</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. But what need I more, their own <hi>Aquiuas</hi> in <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Epiſt. ad Galat.

I know there be many Cavils raiſed againſt this by <hi>Bell.</hi> and other Advocates of the Romiſh Cauſe, but they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly diſcuſſed by our Controverſiſts, and lately <hi>Turretinus exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. de concord.

                  <p>Proceed we now to the third and laſt place, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. which the Pamphleter ſuppoſes <hi>to be clear for their unwritten Traditions:</hi> It's indeed ordinary with Romaniſts, where ever they find menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Traditions in Scripture, to draw it to their unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But this very place diſcovers their miſtake, for the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Traditions by Epiſtle, as well as by word; then ſure there
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:150121:68"/>
are written Traditions. I know nothing that here can be objected, but that he mentions Traditions, not only by Epiſtle, but alſo by word: To which I anſwer, from this indeed it follows, that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Faith were delivered to the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> both by word and writ<hi>:</hi> It holds out theſe two different ways by which Divine Truths were conveyed to them from the Apoſtles; but it cannot be concluded from this Scripture, that any Articles of Faith were delivered by word to this Church of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> which were not contained in the Epiſtles written to them, yet granting, that ſome Articels of Faith had been Orally delivered to them, which were not contained in theſe two Epiſtles to the Church of <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,</hi> yet nothing can be inferred againſt us, except he could prove that theſe Articles were not to be found in any other Scripture. Let this Pamphleter, if he can, give us an account of the Articles of Faith Orally delivered to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> which are not to be found either in theſe Epiſtles, or in any other Scripture; if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, which no Romaniſts as yet have been able to do, let them once learn to acknowledge, that this Scripture makes nothing for them. I muſt remember him that <hi>Bell.</hi> confeſſes, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de verb. Dei cap.</hi> 11. <hi>that the Apoſtles committed to writing whatever was neceſſary;</hi> either then it muſt be acknowledged theſe Traditions are not neceſſary, or elſe, according to <hi>Bell.</hi> they muſt be delivered in the written word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> as I find him cited by M. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> in his <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſafe way, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 46. conjectures, that the Tradition, of which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks, was of the hinderance of the coming of Antichriſt. Grant that the Cardinal hath hit right, yet ſeeing neither he, nor the Romiſh Church, can give an account what that hinderance was which the Apoſtle meant, it ſtill appears, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a Traditive conveyance is, and that the knowledge of that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance cannot be neceſſary now, or a point of Faith, ſeeing God hath permitted it to be loſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 63. and 64. the Pamphleter urges, <hi>that Hereticks, ſuch as</hi> Arrians, Eutychians, Manichees, Neſtorians, Valentinians, <hi>and</hi> Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linariſts, <hi>by collating Scripture with Scripture, did confirm their bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemous Hereſies:</hi> But what is that to the purpoſe? Doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, that collating Scripture is not a mean for finding out the true ſenſe of Scripture? Might he not as well argue, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome by eating do poyſon themſelves, therefore eating is not a mean to preſerve the life of man; or becauſe ſome Hereticks have brought the Teſtimonies of Fathers, Councils, yea, and alſo of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:150121:69"/>
Popes to confirm their Hereſies, therefore none of thoſe do contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to find out the true ſenſe of Scripture? It is Blaſphemy to ſay, that reading or collating of Scripture, is the proper cauſe of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> aſſigns far different cauſes, when <hi>lib. de util. cred. cap.</hi> 1. he defines an Heretick to be one, <hi>qui alicujus temporalis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi &amp; maxime gloriae principatuſque ſui gratiâ, falſas ac novas opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niones vel gignit vel ſequitur:</hi> Where he holds out, that it's from Pride, Avarice, or ſome ſuch vicious Principle, and not from reading or collating Scripture, that men adopt Heretical Opinions; and having once eſpouſed them, they pervert Scriptures to make them appear plauſible: Certainly all miſinterpretations of Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſome prave diſpoſition, either in the Underſtanding, or Will: And our Saviour made uſe of collating Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. as the choiceſt mean to confute ſophiſtical arguings from Scripture. Is there any of the groſs inferences of <hi>Arrians, Neſtorians, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees, &amp;c.</hi> which Fathers, and latter Divines, have not confuted by Scripture? Doth not Popery drive this Pamphleter to a great height of Blaſphemy, when he dares affirm, <hi>that an</hi> Arrian <hi>Cobler impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Tranſubſtantiality of the Son of God with the Father, cannot be confuted by the Scripture?</hi> Does he mean, that a Jeſuit transfiguring himſelf into the ſhape of a Cobler, (as ſome are ſaid to have done, for indeed they can turn themſelves to all ſhapes) hath learned ſuch dexterity from <hi>Lucifer,</hi> as to maintain the blaſphemous Hereſie of <hi>Arrians?</hi> Let him try his Acumen in anſwering the Scriptural Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which <hi>Bell.</hi> hath brought to prove the Conſubſtantiality of the Son of God, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Chriſto,</hi> from <hi>cap.</hi> 4. to 9. incluſive.

How weak is that inference of the <hi>Arrian,</hi> mentioned by the Pamphleter, <hi>that becauſe Chriſt prayed that his Diſciples might be one.</hi> Joh. 17. <hi>therefore to conclude, that he and the Father are one, only in will and affection?</hi> Do not all the Scriptures which prove the Deity of Chriſt, and that the incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable Attributes of the Deity, are applyable to him, demonſtrate him to be Conſubſtantial with the Father? His <hi>other inſtance</hi> is no leſs ridiculous, <hi>from the</hi> Eutychians <hi>concluding, that the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt is changed into the Divine, becauſe, as its ſaid,</hi> Joh. 1. <hi>the Word was made Fleſh: ſo its ſaid,</hi> Joh. 2. <hi>that the Water was turned into Wine.</hi> If there were any ſtrength in that Argument, would it not rather follow, that the Divine N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Were it proper here for me to digreſs to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the reſt of thoſe Hereticks mentioned by the Pamphleter, it were as eaſie to ſhew their inferences to be ludibrious, and inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential, without the aſſiſtance of any infallible viſible Judge, which the Pamphleter, and all the Romiſh Party, will not be able to do, concerning the Proteſtant Religion. Sure he muſt be either a man of ſtrong fancy, or cauterized Conſcience, who is bold to ſay, <hi>that there cannot be ſo clear Scripture brought againſt the Real Preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament,</hi> (he means their Popiſh Tranſubſtantiated Preſence) <hi>as the old condemned Hereticks brought againſt the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt:</hi> Nay, he ſhall find in its proper place, that their Dream of Tranſubſtantiation may be confuted, not only by other luculent Scriptures, but alſo by theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body</hi> (which they apprehend do moſt favour their Cauſe, and which <hi>the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter ſays are ſpoken by the four Evangeliſts, and by the Apoſtle S. Paul:</hi> but it ſeems he is better acquainted with his Maſs-book, than with the four Evangeliſts; for one of them, namely <hi>S. John,</hi> has not thoſe words) where alſo my argument againſt M. <hi>Demſter,</hi> to this purpoſe, ſhall be vindicated from all his frothy Cavils: I know <hi>Fathers of old did prove the reality of Chriſts Humane Nature againſt</hi> Marcionites, <hi>from his Symbolical Preſence in the Sacrament;</hi> for if Sacramental Bread and Wine be Types, Symbols, and Figures of his Body and Blood, as they are termed by Fathers, then ſurely he had a real Body, and real Blood<hi>:</hi> But does it from this follow, that they believed a Tranſubſtantiated Preſence? Nay, on the contrary, in as much as the Sacramental Bread and Wine are called by them Types, Figures, and Symbols of his Body and Blood, it appears they held them not to be his very Body and Blood. And here, by the way, I muſt adviſe him, not to expoſe his ignorance to ſuch publick view, as here he doth by citing <hi>S. Chryſoſt. Hom.</hi> 6. as if <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Homilies but upon one place of Scripture, ſuch Lax Citations will make people ſuſpect, that Jeſuits are not ſo well verſed in the Fathers, as they would make the world believe.</p>

Secondly, He dare not commit the explication of Scripture either to Tradition, or the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous conſent of Fathers; and therefore he keeps <hi>the definition of the preſent Church</hi> as a Reſerve, in <hi>caſe of doubts concerning theſe,</hi> and of <hi>doubts which may be moved concerning the ſenſe of Traditions, and of the teſtimonies of Fathers.</hi> And therefore all muſt be ultimately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on the definition of the preſent <hi>Church,</hi> they mean the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Church: So that when all comes to all, their Faith is built upon the word of their Pope, or Council, for nothing elſe can he mean by their <hi>Preſent Church.</hi> But thirdly, ſeeing the deciſions of Faith are remitted <hi>unto the preſent Church,</hi> that is, Pope or Council, when the caſe is dubious concerning the ſenſe of Scriptures, Traditions, and Fathers; what is now left to be a ground for the Churches definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but either Enthuſiaſm, or a Fancy? So that by this very ſtate of the queſtion, when its well pondered, the ground of the belief of the preſent Romiſh Church, is becauſe ſhe fancies ſo. Fourthly, In this ſtate of the queſtion, he ſpeaks as if Romaniſts were all agreed concerning the Rule of Faith, or Judge of Controverſies; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof is apparent from what we ſpake, both in the former queſtion concerning the infallible viſible Judge, and alſo here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

Fifthly, Doth he not repreſent us as building our Faith on <hi>corrupted Scriptures?</hi> Is not this an evidence of a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Cauſe, when we muſt be ſo perfidiouſly repreſented? So far are Proteſtants from building on corrupted Scriptures, that we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the pure Originals, and decline no mean for finding out the ſenſe of Scripture ever acknowledged by the Catholick Church.

Take another inſtance from the Bull of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth, againſt the five Propoſitions of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> which the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits apprehend to be wholly in their favours; and yet what various ſenſes are impoſed thereon by the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> may appear from the Diſquiſitions of <hi>Paulus Irenaeus,</hi> ſubjoyned to the Notes of <hi>Wendro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kius</hi> upon the Provincial Letters at <hi>Helm ſtad, Anno</hi> 1664. Hence it follows, that if various ſenſes impoſed upon the ſentence of a Judge, conclude that the giver of thoſe ſentences is not the Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, then both Pope and Council are alike to be degraded from being Judges. I anſwer therefore thirdly, That its enough that the Supreme Judge give out Law ſo clear, that all Subjects might underſtand his ſentences, if the diſability be not from themſelves: And ſuch are the Scriptures of God, though the prejudices of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel Jews will not let them underſtand that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> doth it therefore follow, that the Scriptures have not clearly declared him to be the <hi>Meſſiah?</hi> or if <hi>Ebionites</hi> and <hi>Arrians</hi> will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Chriſt to be God, doth it follow he is not there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to be the true God? or if <hi>Socinians</hi> will not acknowledge him to have ſatisfied Divine Juſtice, is it not therefore clearly enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Scripture?

               <p>There is nothing which ſtartles Modern Romaniſts more, than the diſtinction of Fundamentals and non-Fundamentals, or Eſſentials and Integrals in Religion: Nor can <hi>I</hi> ſee any other reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the diſtinction, when its clearly penetrated, and well improved, doth diſcover the Schiſmatical and imperious uſurpation of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and contributes exceedingly to the clearing of the Unity of the Catholick Church, notwithſtanding of the differences that may be among particular Churches; whereas the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> like that Gyant <hi>Procruſtes,</hi> would be excluding all from the Catholick Church, who do not in all things come up to her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: I hope therefore, it may be of ſome uſe, to unfold a little of the nature of this diſtinction.</p>
               <p>But firſt I muſt take ſome notice of an invidious repreſentation of the diviſions of Proteſtants, concerning the number of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, made by the Pamphleter <hi>pag.</hi> 84. <hi>Some,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſuppoſe them to be contained in the Creed, ſome in the Decalogue, ſome in the Lords Prayer, ſome in all joyntly; ſome to theſe add the Sacraments.</hi> Had he looked homeward, he might have found that which would have

How then have theſe men a face, to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge others of their diviſions, about the number of Fundamentals? Had the Pamphleter conſidered the diſtinction betwixt <hi>credenda, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienda, petenda,</hi> he would have ſeen theſe forementioned ſeeming dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties among Proteſtants were not ſo hard to be reconciled.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THat there be no logomachy concerning the ſubject of the preſent Diſpute, I ſhall ſeek no other deſcription of a Fundamental Verity in Religion, than that which the Pamphleter gives <hi>page</hi> 90. <hi>It is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>either that which makes us believe all the reſt, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the expreſs knowledge and beliefe thereof, none can be ſaved.</hi> Now this being the notion of Fundamental Truth, I conceive it cannot be aſſerted rationally, that all Truths of the Chriſtian Religion are Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental. If by Fundamental be underſtood, that for which other Articles are to be believed, then ſure we muſt ſuppoſe, there be other particulars which are believed for that. As there is a formal Object and Rule of Faith, ſo there are diſtinct material Objects of Faith. If therefore a Fundamental and the formal Object or Rule of Faith, which is the reaſon for which the reſt are believed, be one and the ſame, then as many material Objects as there be in Chriſtianity, there be as many Non-Fundamentals. If you take a Fundamental for that, without the explicite belief whereof none can be ſaved, I am ſure likewiſe, there be many Non-Fundamentals in Religion. Elſe the Romiſh implicite Colliar, and all who walk in his Footſteps, as do the plurality of their Communion, muſt be damned eternally. If all Truths of the Chriſtian Religion were of abſolute neceſſity to Salvation, and Fundamentals, what meant the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11, 12. to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Foundation, and Gold, Silver, and Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones built thereupon? There be then precious Truths built upon the Foundation, which yet are not the Foundation. Or what meant the Author to the Hebrewes <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 1. by that foundation
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:150121:77"/>
of Repentance from dead Works, and of Faith toward God, when he is quickening them to purſue after other Truths? If all Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith be Fundamental, and the explicite belief thereof abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation, than who ever did live or die in any error of Religion were damned eternally. What then ſhould become of the believing multitude of whom ſaid S. <hi>Auſtin lib. cont. Epiſt. Fundam. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Turbam non intelligendi vivacitas ſed credendi ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citas tutiſſimam facit,</hi> and ſo may be obnoxious to many errours in Religion. But what ſpeak I of the Multitude? What did become of all the Fathers, who were leavened with the Millenary error, of whom an account may be received from <hi>Sixtus Senenſis lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Bibl. annot.</hi> 233. and <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>annot.</hi> 347. or of the Fathers who denyed that the Souls of Juſt men are admitted to the beatifique Viſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of Judgement, of whom a Liſt may be had from <hi>Senenſis lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Bibl. Annot.</hi> 345. What did become of <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Firmilian, Deny's</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who maintained rebaptization? What became of <hi>Auſtine, Innocent</hi> the 1. and others, who, as <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donat</hi> witneſſes in <hi>John</hi> 6. 53. affirmed the Euchariſt was neceſſary to the ſalvation of Infants? Were all theſe Fathers damned eternally? Surely either the points about which they erred were not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or theſe Errors have damned the Fathers of the Church eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Do we not know but in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 9. <hi>Who can underſtand his Errors,</hi> Pſal. 19. 12. If every Error did plunge men into Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, who then could be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>I know the ordinary reply, <hi>That the Church then had not explicitely declared againſt theſe Errors, and therefore though the Errors concerning the Millenium, the excluſion of Saints from the Beatiſique Viſion, Rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization, the neceſſity of the Euchariſt, be Hereſies now, in regard of of the declaration of the Church, yet were not in the dayes of the Fathers.</hi> This ſuppoſes another abſurd Error, which I hope <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute, <hi>viz.

Fourthly, the true reaſon therefore why the Fathers, notwithſtanding their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, were not heretical, but of the ſame Religion with us, becauſe their errours were only againſt integrals of Religion, but not againſt Fundamentals, neither did they pertinaciouſly maintain them, but were willing to have renounced them, had they been convinced that they were contrary to the Scripture, which to them was the Rule of Faith, as well as to us: So that to them might have been ſaid, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> to <hi>Vincentius Victor, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de orig. animae cap.</hi> 15. <hi>Iſte animus etiam in dictis per ignorantiam non Catholicus, ipſa eſt correctionis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditatione Catholicus,</hi> a Soul maintaining errours contrary to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrine, yet willing to ſubmit upon conviction, upon that virtual repentance or premeditation of correction; to uſe S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> word, is truly Catholick, namely, when the Errours ſtrike not at the Foundation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the ſame Father ſpoke in the forecited teſtimony, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Julian. cap.</hi> 6.</p>

The ſevere ſentence pronounced in the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed (which yet I muſt advertiſe the Pamphleter, to be doubted whether it were drawn by the Great <hi>Athanaſius)</hi> is only againſt thoſe who deny any Article of that Creed.

                  <p>To conclude this Section, <hi>E. W. the Author of Proteſtancy without Principles,</hi> that is <hi>Edward Worſley,</hi> an Engliſh Jeſuit at <hi>Antwerp, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath much ſpongious talk to confute the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants diſtinction of Fundamentals and Non Fundamentals, as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and falſe. I ſhould but beat the Air to examine all. Himſelf comprizes the ſubſtance of what he has ſaid in this one argument; <hi>Every revealed Article is aſſerted by an Infinite Verity; but an Infinite</hi>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:150121:80"/>
                     <hi>Verity delivers all it ſpeaks with one and the ſame infinite certainty;</hi> Ergo, <hi>all Articles of Faith have one and the ſame like infinite aſſurance, conſequently, one is as ponderous as another, and equally Fundamental.</hi> To this I briefly anſwer (forbearing to reflect again upon the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Jeſuits Syllogiſm) granting as uncontroverted the whole Syllogiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is an equal objective certainty in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely revealed Articles, in a compounded ſenſe, with divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it being abſolutely impoſſible that divine Revelation ſhould be falſe; but withal peremptorily denying the Corallary which he infers from his Syllogiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> that therefore all Articles of Faith are equally ponderous and Fundamental, that is, (unleſs he intend to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocate) that there is an equal neceſſity of the explicit belief of every one of them to the eternal ſalvation of ſouls. This conſequent I deny, becauſe though all revealed Articles be revealed by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Verity, and with an infinite certainty, yet not with equal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity, and ſo are not with equal facility penetrable by our weak underſtandings, nor is the explicit belief of all impoſed under the ſame ſevere Sanctions, nor put under the ſame inſeparable connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the ſalvation of ſouls. That it is ſo, may eaſily be evinced againſt any Romaniſt that will but hearken to his own reaſon: For it cannot be denied, that there be ſome Articles of Religion, without the explicite belief whereof, no adult rational perſon that hath the ſenſe of reaſon (for I abſtract from the caſes of Infants, deaf, and mad-men) can be ſaved, as that there is a God, or immortal Soul, at leaſt <hi>Directo</hi> and <hi>Roſſello</hi> themſelves will require the explicit belief of that Popiſh fundamental, of believing what the Church believes, which according to them, is alſo a revealed Verity. But it is as clear there be other revealed Articles, without the explicit belief where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of adult rational hearing perſons may in ſome caſes be ſaved: Yea Jeſuit <hi>Azorius Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Moral. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. confeſſes a man may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without the explicit belief of the Trinity, and that he may have blaſphemiouſly groſs conceptions of God without Hereſie, as that God hath corporeal dimenſions like a man, that God the Father is greater in power, and more Ancient than God the Son: And he brings in <hi>Panormitan,</hi> and others of their great Doctors, affirming, that theſe groſs conceptions of God may not only be without Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, but alſo without ſin, providing their Darling Principle of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving what their Church believes be acquieſced unto: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit belief of all revealed Verities is not impoſed with the ſame ſevere Sanction, nor put under the ſame inſeparable connexion with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:150121:80"/>
the eternal ſalvation of Souls, conſequently, all are not equally fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental. I confeſs whatever diſparity be betwixt the material ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Faith, as in themſelves conſidered, yet if a man know them to be revealed by God, he is bound to believe them all, with the moſt firm adheſion of mind, the meaneſt no leſs than the higheſt; and if in that caſe he ſhould misbelieve any of the leaſt of them, he would err fundamentally, becauſe he would explicitly deny the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Divine Verity. And this is all which Jeſuit <hi>Worſleys</hi> arguments do prove, which is not the thing controverted concerning Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals. That which we affirm is, that ſome Truths are ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the infinite Verity, that men are bound to believe them; yet if either through the weakneſs of their underſtandings, prejudices of education, or other ſuch like impediments, they do not diſcern them to be revealed, they may through mercy be ſaved, provided they have a ſincere willingneſs to believe every Article which they know to be revealed by the infinite Verity, and do unfeignedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, not only of their known ſins, but alſo <hi>de occultis</hi> of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and unknown errours<hi>:</hi> Excellently ſaid ſaid S. <hi>Auſtin, Epiſt.</hi> 162. <hi>Qui ſententiam ſuam, quamvis falſam atque perverſam nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The two laſt teſtimonies of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> together with thoſe of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Senenſis</hi> the Pamphleter, <hi>pag.</hi> 101. endeavours to elude by ſome ludibrious diſtinctions: <hi>It is true,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>moſt Scriptures are clear to Eminent Doctors, not to all indifferently: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they are clear to ſuch as take the places of Scripture, commanding us to hear the Church, and hold faſt Traditions, as two main Fundamentals for clearing all the reſt, and to ſuch as level the line of Prophetical and Apoſtolical interpretation to the ſquare of Eccleſiaſtical ſenſe, but not to others.</hi> And here again he would abuſe D. <hi>Field, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <hi>as if he did favour the Popiſh Doctrine of unwritten Fundamentals,</hi> whereas the Doctor has nothing to that purpoſe: But he muſt not be ſuffered thus to ſneak away.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, the Authors cited by me, ſpeak not only of the perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity of the Scripture, but alſo of the fulneſs thereof<hi>:</hi> S. <hi>Chryſoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> is expreſs, that all things neceſſary are clear in Scripture<hi>:</hi> So alſo is S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de doct. Chriſti cap.</hi> 9. Though therefore it were granted, that they meant, as the Pamphleter falſly ſuggeſts, that the Scriptures were only clear to Eminent Doctors, yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but they affirmed that Scripture contained all neceſſary and Fundamental Truths. But ſecondly, it's a manifeſt falſhood that theſe Fathers did reſtrict the perſpicuity of Scripture to Eminent Doctors, yea <hi>Chryſoſt. Hom.</hi> 3. in 2 <hi>Theſ. cap.</hi> 3. expreſly ſpeaks to people as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from Teachers, and chides them as neglecting Reading when they want Teachers. So that either the Pamphleter never read that place of <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> or bewrays too much diſingenuity. As for S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom's Hom.</hi> 14. in <hi>Joh.</hi> objected by the Pamphleter, there he only
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:150121:82"/>
ſays, diligence muſt be uſed in ſearching of the Scriptures, but does not at all reſtrict that diligence in ſearching Scriptures to Doctors of the Church; yea, <hi>Hom.</hi> 10. in <hi>Joh.</hi> and <hi>Conc.</hi> 3. <hi>de Lazaro,</hi> he is much in preſſing the people to read the Scriptures: And in <hi>Epiſt ad Coloſ. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Hom.</hi> he urgeth them to do it, <hi>magno ſtudio &amp; diligentia:</hi> There is as little ground to ſay, that S. <hi>Auſtin lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de doctrina Chriſti, cap.</hi> 9. intended to reſtrict the perſpicuity of Scripture to Eminent Doctors. Surely in <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Creſc. cap.</hi> 33. (the Pamphleter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in haſte, cited the <hi>Cap.</hi> but not the Book) there is nothing againſt the fulneſs or perſpicuity of Scripture, only in an obſcure queſtion, when <hi>nullum de Scripturis Canonicis profertur exemplum,</hi> then <hi>Auſtin</hi> adviſes the Church to be conſulted with, which no man denieth: But in evidence that he derogateth nothing from the Scriptures, <hi>cap.</hi> 32. he ſaid, <hi>Sequimur ſane nos hac in re Canonicarum certiſſimam authoritatem Scripturarum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> And in <hi>cap.</hi> 33. <hi>Sancta Scriptura fallere non poteſt, &amp; Eccleſia ſine ulla ambiguitate Sancta Scriptura demonſtrat.</hi> I am remitted by the Pamphleter to two teſtimonies from S. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> one from <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 49. whereas I have told him before, there are but 35 <hi>cap.</hi> in all that Book<hi>:</hi> The other is from <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 47. I have read that <hi>Cap.</hi> but find nothing to his purpoſe, nor does he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any words from him. Is not this a notable juggle on ſimple perſons, to cite Fathers at ſuch a rate? Yet thirdly, were that preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſtinction admitted, it would at leaſt follow, that the Faith of Eminent Doctors were to be reſolved on the Scriptures, for to them they are granted to be clear in all things neceſſary. Fourthly, do we ſay that the Scripture is indifferently clear to all, as the Pamphleter doth here inſinuate? To a Jeſuit faſcinated with prejudice, to an implicit Colliar, or Proſelyte, whoſe eyes Jeſuits have pulled out, or to them whoſe eyes the God of this World hath blinded, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. verily not. Such perverting of the ſtate of the queſtion does be wray a deſperate cauſe. Fifthly, the Adverſary, fearing that his firſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction concerning Eminent Doctors ſhould not hold water, betakes himſelf to another of taking theſe Commands, of hearing the Church, and holding faſt Traditions, as two main Fundamentals. But <hi>I</hi> have ſhewed, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. that the command of hearing the Church is to be underſtood ſo long as ſhe adheres to her Commiſſion, which is contained in the Scripture: and <hi>cap.</hi> 3. that it is more than any Romaniſt can prove, that by Traditions. in that Exhortation, hold faſt Traditions, are underſtood Praeter-Scriptural Traditions, ſo that theſe Scriptures make nothing for unwritten Fundamentals.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:150121:82"/>
This diſtinction of the Pamphleter, coincides, upon the matter, with that of Jeſuit <hi>Baylie in Catech.</hi> 8, 9. that the Fathers affirmed Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to contain all things neceſſary, becauſe they contain all implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for when they direct us to believe the Catholick Church, they direct us to believe all the Traditions which the Church believes. To this ludicrous anſwer, <hi>Rivet</hi> excellently replys, that then the Fathers, by giving theſe Elogies to Scripture, had commended it no more, than if they had called a man Learned, who points out the way to the School, or ſaid that ſuch an one had milk to ſuckle an Infant, who only can ſhew where a Nurſe is to be found, or that one has a well covered Table, who can but declare who hath it, which were ludibrious. If it were ſo, why was the Holy Ghoſt at pains to write all theſe Books of holy Scripture? Then there needed no more Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but hear the Church, as indeed <hi>Gordon</hi> of <hi>Huntly controv.</hi> 1. <hi>de verb. Dei cap.</hi> 27. ſays, that all Articles of Faith are contained in that one Article of the Creed, <hi>I believe the Catholick Church.</hi> Why then ſhould they not likewiſe be all contained in that great and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Fundamental, <hi>I believe the truth of all that God reveals?</hi> and conſequently a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> ſhall be as good a Catholick as any Jeſuit. But ſixthly, let me argue a little from theſe two Scriptures, <hi>Hear the Church, and hold faſt Traditions;</hi> either theſe are clear in themſelves, or not: if not, how can they clear all the reſt? if they be, why is the like perſpicuity denied to other Scriptures containing as neceſſary truths? Seventhly, What is that ſquare of Eccleſiaſtick ſenſe, whereto the Pamphleter would level all Scriptural interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Is it Tradition? Though Proteſtants, with <hi>Vincent Lirinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> do grant to Tradition its due place among the means of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture, yet now I muſt enquire, what if a queſtion ariſe about Tradition it ſelf? Has not this Pamphleter told, <hi>pag.</hi> 75. that then all muſt be referred to the definition of the preſent Catholick Church, that is, to their infallible viſible Judge; and ſo the reſult of all theſe Cob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>web diſtinctions, is this, They can grant that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is clear in Fundamentals, provided nothing be taken as the ſenſe of Scripture, but what their Pope or Infallible Judge pleaſes: And conſequently, when <hi>Chryſoſt. Auſtin, &amp;c.</hi> ſay, that Scripture contains clearly all that is neceſſary, the meaning is, that Scripture contains not the Articles of Religion clearly, but points to one who can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold them? Are not theſe goodly gloſſes which Jeſuits put upon Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Muſt the World be cheated with ſuch ludicrous non<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſenſe? as if the end of Scripture were to point out their infallible Judge,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:150121:83"/>
and yet it cannot be known what is Scripture, or the true ſenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but by the ſentences of that pretended infallible Judge. Are all things in Scripture clear, and yet nothing at all clear, but to receive its clearneſs from the Romiſh Judge, who is alledged to be pointed out in Scripture, and yet there is not one word of him in all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I pray in what Text of Scripture is the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Crown, and Infallible Chair, together with the enthuſiaſtick ſquare of Eccleſiaſtick ſenſe, treaſured up in his breaſt. I ingenuouſly profeſs I cannot find the place, unleſs it be 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3, 4. or <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>It's objected by the Pamphleter, <hi>pag.</hi> 99. <hi>that the Fathers who writ Catalogues of Hereſies,</hi> Irenaeus, Tertull. Philaſtrius, Epiphanius, Auſtin, &amp;c. <hi>did not diſtinguiſh betwixt Fundamentals and integrals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Divine Truths, for they condemned many leſſer things as Hereſies, and conſequently as damnable errours. The</hi> Aerians <hi>are condemned as Hereticks by</hi> Epiphanius; Haereſ. 75. <hi>And</hi> Auſtin Haereſ. 33. <hi>(he ſhould have ſaid</hi> 53.) <hi>for denying the Faſts commanded by the Church: The</hi> Eunomians <hi>by</hi> Auſtin, Haereſ. 54. <hi>for teaching, that no ſin could hurt a man, if ſo be he had Faith: The deniers of Free-will by</hi> Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 64. Vigilantius <hi>by</hi> Hierom, <hi>for affirming that Relicks of Saints ought not to be reverenced:</hi> Jovinian <hi>by</hi> Auſtin Haereſ. 82. <hi>for holding Wedlock equal in dignity to Virginity:</hi> Pelagians <hi>by</hi> Auſtin lib. cont. Julian. cap. 2. <hi>for teaching that the children of faithful Parents need not Baptiſm, as being born holy; and the</hi> Arrians <hi>by</hi> Auſtin, lib. 1. cont. Maxim. cap. 2. <hi>for not receiving Tradition: All which,</hi> ſays the Pamphleter, <hi>is the Doctrine of Proteſtants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatever ſhew this Objection may have with ignorant perſons, yet I muſt advertiſe them, it's but a <hi>crambe recocta:</hi> Theſe Hereſies have been often objected by calumniating Romaniſts, <hi>Bellar. Breerly, &amp;c.</hi> and as often confuted by Learned Proteſtants, D. <hi>Field,</hi> D. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Gerard, Whittaker, Rivet, &amp;c.</hi> yea, and many more Hereſies have been retorted <hi>cum faenore,</hi> out of the ſame Catalogues upon the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Briefly therefore I anſwer two things, and firſt, that neither Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt nor Proteſtant can admit, that all the Errours mentioned in the Catalogues of <hi>Epiphanius, Philaſtrius, Auſtin, &amp;c.</hi> are Fundamental<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Are there not many condemned in them for Opinions in matters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputable, undetermined, and of ſmall conſequence, and which reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively are acquitted in both ſides.

It will not be amiſs here to remember, that D. <hi>Hackwell</hi> in his Apology, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8 §. 1. records out of <hi>Aventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his <hi>Hiſtoria Boiorum, Anno</hi> 745. that Pope <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> condemned one <hi>Virgilius;</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salsburg,</hi> as an Heretick; for holding that there were Antipodes; and perhaps were induced hereto by the Authority of <hi>Auſtin, lib.</hi> 16. <hi>de civit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dei cap.</hi> 9. and of <hi>Lactantius inſtit. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 24.

                  <p>Beſides, if all be Fundamental Errours which are recorded in the Catalogues of Hereſies, I am ſure Romaniſts do err Fundamentally: Were not the <hi>Collyridians</hi> condemned as Hereticks by <hi>Epiphan.

What ſhould I reckon out <hi>Pelagians, Donatiſts, Euſtathians, Marcits,</hi> the <hi>Nudi-pedales,</hi> yea <hi>Rivet Cathol. Orthod. Proaem. de Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ.</hi> reckons forth a Catalogue of fifty Ancient Hereſies ingroſſed in the Romiſh Religion.

                  <p>I anſwer ſecondly, that it's a notorious falſhood that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches do own all the particulars mentioned in the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleters Objection, I might remit him to the Authors who have long ago confuted theſe old raucid Calumnies, yet a touch I give of them.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, we maintain not with <hi>Eunomians, that if a man had Faith, and retained his Profeſſion, how impiouſly ſoever be lived, be might be ſaved.</hi> D. <hi>Field,</hi> when he is repelling this calumny of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. breaks forth in theſe words: <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>any of us ever wrote, ſpake, or thought any ſuch thing, let God forget e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to do good unto us, and let our prayers be rejected from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; but if this be as vile a ſlander as ever Sataniſt deviſed, the Lord reward them that have been the Authors and deviſers of it.</hi> Who would not have thought that this ſerious proteſtation would have ſtopped the mouths of Romaniſts for ever? Yet this impudent Calumniator has the confidence to come over with it again: If our Proteſtation be not ſufficient to clear us, yet, I hope, <hi>Bellarmines</hi> confeſſion may be heard.

This being a truth clear from Scriptures, and acknowledged by Learned Romaniſts, as well as by Fathers and Proteſtants, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the debates <hi>de ſtatu primi hominis.</hi> But if <hi>Origen</hi> meant by the Image of God, the Natural Faculties of the Rational Soul, ſure it was an errour, and diſallowed by Proteſtants, to ſay, that the Image of God was loſt; for faln man, in ſo far as he has a Rational Nature, is ſaid <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 6. to bear the Image of God. The ſame diſtinction is given in behalf of <hi>Origen</hi> by <hi>Alphonſus à Caſtro de Haereſ. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>tit. Adam.

againſt Fundamental truths, or that we owned all the errours enumerated in the Objection.</p>
                  <p>It's further objected, <hi>pag.</hi> 89. <hi>that Scripture would make a man think, that one thing, or at moſt two, were neceſſary to ſalvation; as ſometimes the believing one point, ſometimes the doing of another. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is promiſed to Prayer in one place, to Alms deeds in another; and</hi> Mat. 19. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments, teaches a Fundamental which Proteſtants ſay is impoſſible.</hi> Is not this a daring impiety in a laſcivious Jeſuit, ſo to ſport with the Scriptures of the Living God, as if ſometimes they made one thing only neceſſary to ſalvation, ſometime another. For anſwer therefore; he would firſt remember, that our preſent queſtion is concerning the <hi>Credenda,</hi> things to be believed; but moſt of theſe inſtances are of the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>enda,</hi> things to be done by us: Whether this proceeded from his inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, or were done purpoſely, to caſt a blind before an unwary Reader, is remitted to his ſecond thoughts. Secondly, it is a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that Scripture makes ſometimes only Prayer, at other times only Alms-deeds; at one time only Faith in the Son of God, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time only the feer of the Lord, a Fundamental, as the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter inſinuates<hi>:</hi> For no where is the promiſe of Salvation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted to any one of theſe, with excluſion of the reſt<hi>:</hi> When the promiſe is made ſometime to one grace, ſometime to another, it only imports the inſeparable connexion of all ſanctifying graces, that who ever has one, hath undoubtedly all. Thirdly, I grant, that in that word Mar. 19. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> is contained a Fundamental of the Covenant of Works, but not of the Goſpel Covenant. This is evident from that deſcription of the two Covenants, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. to 9. <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribeth the righteouſneſs of the Law, <hi>that the man who doth theſe things ſhall live by them; but the righteouſneſs of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and believe in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> Where the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect keeping of the Commandments is ſet forth to be the righteouſneſs of the Law, as the righteouſneſs of the Law is contradiſtinguiſhed from the righteouſneſs of Faith. Yet Chriſt does not mock the young man by that word, as the ſcoffing Jeſuit <hi>Maldonat</hi> on the place would infer from this Expoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> given by <hi>Calvin,</hi> for this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law would really bring a man to eternal life, if a man truly had it: Neither is any mean ſo apt to convince a Juſticia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pretending to a legal righteouſneſs (ſuch an one was that young

man, as appears by his words, verſ. 20. <hi>All theſe things have I kept from my youth)</hi> as to charge him with the righteouſneſs of the Law. Chriſt therefore uſed a very proper mean for preparing that perſon to ſubmit to the righteouſneſs of God by Faith, <hi>Phil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In what ſenſe the perfect keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law is poſſible, or impoſſible, is elſewhere declared<hi>:</hi> now only I add, that neither under the Goſpel Covenant can Eternal Life be obtained, without a ſincere and ſerious endeavour to keep the Commands perfectly: But ſurely if the perfect keeping of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments were a Fundamental of the Goſpel Covenant, our ranting Miſſionaries, and their diſſolute Proſelytes, might deſpair of ſalvation.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:150121:87"/>
it is a principle having an intrinſick evidence of its Divine Original, as I endeavoured to ſhew in its proper place, yet I confeſs that our minds are prepared, by the motives of credibility, (whereof Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is one) to give a ſupernatural aſſent to the Scriptures as the Word of God; and this is all which <hi>Auſtin</hi> affirmed as to this thing, as hath been already cleared. Here it is to be noted, that though I call the Scripture a Fundamental, as being the Rule of Faith, yet I mean not, that the belief of this written Inſtrument is abſolutely neceſſary in all caſes to ſalvation; for who doth not know that of <hi>Iren. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Multae gentes Barbarorum credunt in Chriſtum ſine charactere vel atramento, i.e.</hi> many Nations of the Barbarians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Chriſt without this writing of holy Scripture.

So that if they who are invincibly ignorant of the Scriptures, ſhould upon the Veracity of God, believe the Doctrines of Chriſtianity contained in Scripture, and walk accordingly, they ſhould be ſaved even as we. But what (ſaith the Pamphleter) if one ſhould receive the New Teſtament, as containing ſufficiently all Fundamentals, and reject the Old; with <hi>Manichees,</hi> admit of ſome Evangels, but not others with <hi>Ebionits?

Dei cap.</hi> 7. and have been fully vindicated by <hi>Chamier, Whittaker, Davenant, Strange &amp;c.</hi> yet they are here propounded, as if nothing had been replyed to them<hi>:</hi> I begin with the laſt from Auſtin, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de bapt. contra Donat. cap.</hi> 23. becauſe in it the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter ſays, <hi>that</hi> Auſtin <hi>affirms a Fundamental; namely, Infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm not to be contained in Scripture.</hi> This citation demonſtrates, that the Pamphleter has never read <hi>Auſtin;</hi> for in that <hi>cap.</hi> he has nothing of the Baptiſm of Infants, but only ſays, that the cuſtom of not rebaptizing thoſe who had been baptized by Hereticks, was received by Tradition: Neither is this a Fundamental, elſe S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had erred Fundamentally, who ſtill adhered to his Opinion of Rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, though as <hi>Auſtin</hi> in that ſame <hi>cap.</hi> ſays, he were preſſed, both with the cuſtom of the Church, and Pope <hi>Stephens</hi> Authority, to the contrary: Nor could <hi>Auſtin</hi> mean, that the cuſtom of the Church in this thing was not warranted by Scriptural Authority, for frequently he diſputes that ſame point of Rebaptization againſt the Donatiſts from Scripture, as <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conſequently <hi>Auſtin</hi> only meant, that there was no expreſs prohibition of Rebaptization in <hi>terminis,</hi> or that there could no example from Scripture be produced of receiving one into the Church, who had been baptized by a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, without Rebaptization: Both which we grant; and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm with <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and the Catholick Church, that Scripture affords ſufficient ground againſt Rebaptization.</p>
                  <p>His other teſtimony is from <hi>Epiphan. Haereſ.</hi> 61. <hi>we muſt uſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, for the Scriptures have not all.</hi> To this it's anſwered, that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piph.</hi> doth not there ſpeak of Fundamentals. The point which he is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting is, that it's a ſin, after Vowed Virginity, to Marry, which is a truth; for either there is ſin in vowing raſhly, not conſidering
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:150121:88"/>
what ſtrength there is to perform, or by breaking the Vow unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, if there be ſtrength to abſtain. Yet <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in the ſame place affirms, that in the caſe of Vowed Virginity, it's better to Marry, than ſecretly to Fornicate, or as he expreſſes it, <hi>occultis ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis ſauciari,</hi> the contrary whereof is aſſerted by <hi>Bell. Caſter,</hi> and other Romaniſts: However, I hope Romaniſts are not ſo large in their Fundamentals, as to make that one.

As Chriſt did many things which are not written, ſo is it probable that the Apoſtles taught the Churches many things Orally, and particularly did expound to them difficult places in their own writings. But as the memory of the unwritten works of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

is quite loſt, ſo alſo have the Traditive Expoſitions of difficult Scriptures periſhed many Ages ago, inſomuch that the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are broken into many different Opinions concerning obſcure Scriptures: By which it appears, that Records are a more faithful keeper than Reports.

But this is a notorious prevarication<hi>:</hi> For all Proteſtants do acknowledge, that we are bound to believe whatever God is pleaſed to reveal unto us; yea, not to aſſent to the leaſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial object of Faith, when it is known that God has revealed it, were an impeaching of the Veracity of God, and ſo hainous a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſs, that if continued in, ſhould aſſuredly damn eternally.

He that believes, though erroniouſly, any thing to be revealed by God, and yet will contradict it, is hainouſly guilty of derogation from the Veracity of God. The moſt that Proteſtants affirm (to which all ſolid Chriſtians ever aſſented) is, that through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our underſtanding, we not being able to penetrate all truths divinely revealed, we may ſometimes ſuppoſe that not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God, which is revealed by him, or that to be revealed by him, which is not revealed.

This we have already confirmed by Scripture and Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. Laying aſide therefore his falſe ſtate of the queſtion, the true ſtate of the queſtion is, whether whatever the Church propoſes as an Article of Faith muſt be believed under pain of damnation, and conſequently is to be held as a Fundamental, ſo as without the belief thereof no ſalvation can be had; in this indeed we maintain the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and my Adverſary, and Jeſuited Romaniſts, the Affirmative. That this is the true ſtate of the queſtion, may be evicted from the Pamphleter himſelf: For after his deceitful miſrepreſentations of the queſtion, at length he comes above board, <hi>pag.</hi> 92. thus: <hi>The Church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in her publick Decrees of General Councils, ſtrikes with the Thunder-bolt of Gods Curſe and Excommunication, all ſuch as refuſe to believe any one point decided to be of Faith, which ſhe could not juſtly do, if every Article ſhe declares were not neceſſarily to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when known to be decided by her:</hi> It's therefore the deciſion by her that ſays the neceſſity of believing upon ſouls.

I ſhall not inſiſt upon a large conſutation of this abſurd Doctrine, which cannot but ruine with its own weight, not being ſupported with any ſolid ground; only take theſe brief hints. 1. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, in all her Repreſentatives, ſince the Apoſtolick Age, is fallible, as I demonſtrated by many arguments <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. and may injoyn Errours for Articles of Faith; <hi>Ergo,</hi> all that the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the Catholick Church injoyn as Articles of Faith, are not to be held as Fundamentals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This one argument is ſufficient to overturn that Romiſh Structure. But 2. It's an intollerable Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chreſis to affirm the Romiſh Church, much more the Pope, to be the Catholick Church, or to attribute the peculiar priviledges of the Catholick Church to the Roman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to the Pope; by as good reaſon they might affirm <hi>Italy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> to be the whole World, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate that of <hi>Rome</hi> which is peculiar to the whole World, <hi>Ergo,</hi> though it were granted that the Catholick Church, or her Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, had power infallibly to determine Fundamentals of Faith, it does not follow, that this is the priviledge of the Roman Church, or Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> as our Adverſaries affirm. 3. Every thing that God himſelf reveals in Scripture is not a Fundamental of Faith, <hi>Ergo,</hi> far leſs every thing that the Church propoſes: The ſequel is evident; for if there be any reaſon why every thing propoſed by the Church ſhould be Fundamental, this muſt needs be it, becauſe as Romaniſts affirm, what the Church ſays, God himſelf ſays<hi>:</hi> But this reaſon cannot be cogent, for beyond all peradventure, what is revealed in Scripture is revealed by God himſelf; and yet both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Papiſts acknowledge, that all revealed in Scripture is not Fundamental, therefore neither can all propoſed by the Church be Fundamental. This argument concludes, that though ſhe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, as Scripture truly is, yet would it not follow, that all her definitions were Fundamentals of Faith. It may be here objected, that he who knows a truth to be contained in Scripture, and yet misbelieves it, erres Fundamentally; therefore alſo if the Church be infallible, he who misbelieves any point which he knows to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by her, erreth likewiſe Fundamentally. Not to mention that this objection proceeds upon the ſuppoſition of the Infallibility of the Church, the falſhood whereof, I hope, has already been evict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I anſwer, that he indeed erreth Fundamentally, who misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the leaſt truth which he knows to be contained in Scripture, provided he know the Divine Original of that Scripture; yet not ſo much for misbelieving that particular truth (for in other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:150121:90"/>
it may be misbelieved without a Fundamental errour) as for his explicite misbelief of the Veracity of God, which renders the man an Infidel. But, I hope, Romaniſts themſelves will not ſay, that if Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who queſtioned the Divine Authority of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> had thereupon misbelieved ſome particular Propoſition which he acknowledged to be contained in that Epiſtle, had erred Fundamentally; and conſequently, though the Church were infallible, as ſhe is not, yet if he who queſtioned her Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſhould alſo misbelieve what he knew to be propounded by her, he ſhould not err Fundamentally<hi>:</hi> For in ſo doing, he would not explicitly queſtion the Veracity of God, as in the firſt caſe. 4. If the Propoſals of the Church made Articles Fundamental; <hi>ergo,</hi> after the Churches definition, the Chriſtian Religion ſhould be eſſentially different from what it was before, contrary to <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>there is but one Faith:</hi> The ſequel is evident, becauſe after that definition of the Church, there ſhould be Fundamentals or Eſſentials in Religion which were not before. And from this it follows, the now Roman Religion is eſſentially different from the old Chriſtian Religion<hi>:</hi> For by the new definitions of their Church, they have made many Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials which the Ancient Church never knew, as I demonſtrated againſt M. <hi>Demſter, Paper</hi> 4. 5. I argue with Learned M. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> thus: The Church is a Church before ſhe paſt out her definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ergo,</hi> by her definition ſhe makes no Fundamentals: The ſequel is proved, becauſe the Church cannot be a Church without the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of all Fundamentals; <hi>ergo,</hi> whatever definition ſhe paſſes poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to her being a Church, is none of the Fundamentals. E. <hi>W.</hi> the Author of <hi>Proteſtancy without Principles, Diſcourſe</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. ſuperciliouſly undervalues this argument of D. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> ſuppoſing he hath evicted the nullity thereof by this ſimile: <hi>As in a Kingdom or Commonwealth, after the ſettlement of ſome great matters</hi> (I ſuppoſe he means the Fundamental Laws) <hi>they may thereafter proceed to make new Laws; ſo he conceive: it to be in the Church.</hi> But the faculty of that Jeſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the more Judicious Romaniſts deny, that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:150121:91"/>
the Repreſentatives of the Catholick Church, far leſs of the Roman, or a Pope, have power to make Articles of Faith which were not, but that their power is only declarative of Articles of Faith which formerly were.

If the Church have only a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative power, then ſhe has not ſuch power to make Articles of Faith, as the King and Parliament have to make Laws to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<hi>:</hi> or if ſhe have power to make Articles of Faith, then D<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the King and Parliament ſhould add to the Fundamental Laws of a Kingdom, when addition were made to them, thereafter the Conſtitution of the Kingdom ſhould in ſo far be altered, and different from what it was, conſequently if the Church ſhould add to the Fundamentals of Faith, the Chriſtian Religion ſhould eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vary from what it was before: Nay, if the Church may add to Fundamentals, and make that Fundamental which was not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, why might ſhe not pair from them alſo, and make thoſe things ceaſe to be Fundamentals which were Fundamentals, and ſo overturn all Chriſtianity, and make it a quite different thing from what it was. But the Unity of the Chriſtian Religion, and of the Catholick Church, prove convincingly, that the Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Religion are always the ſame, and unalterable.

                  <p>From what has been ſaid I deduce this Corollary, that the unity of the Catholick Church ſtands in the unity of Fundamentals, and conſequently though there be diverſity of integrals betwixt Churches, yet if the Fundamentals be preſerved, they all make up one Catholick Church; the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, <hi>Waldenſes, Wickleviſts,</hi> and <hi>Huſſites</hi> may differ from us in integrals, yet if the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals

But this general, as I told in my ſixth paper, <hi>pag.</hi> 92. may be proved without an induction and preciſe enumeration of all Fundamentals, and this I made out by clear Scriptures which he never once examined. But 2. take the controverſie betwixt Mr. <hi>Dempſter</hi> and me in the greateſt latitude, It was concerning the religion of Proteſtants, and not of the particular ſentiments of this or that Proteſtant Author, ſeeing therefore as I told in my tenth Paper <hi>pag.</hi> 219. that the Reformed Churches in their harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Confeſſions had not determined that preciſe Catalogue, ſhould I have pitched upon it, I had left my work to follow a tergiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Vagrant. 3.

But Jeſuits will not bluſh, though deprehended in ſuch Peccadillo's. All his pretext for this, is from a teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.

This Pamphleter, as if he had been left to divine concerning the Author of that teſtimony, ſpeakes as one that gave a ſpecimen of his great reading, ſaying Mr, <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, is the Man, as I conceive,</hi> and yet I had in my tenth <hi>paper pag.</hi> 219. not only named <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> but pointed at <hi>Cap</hi> and <hi>Sect</hi> where this teſtimony was to be found. 2. This was Mr. <hi>Chillingworths</hi> aſſertion not mine, The moſt I ſaid of it, was <hi>paper.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 92. What if it ſhould be added, that more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the Salvation of one then another, whereupon a great Divine, whom I by name expreſſed <hi>paper.</hi> 10. <hi>pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 219. ſpared not to ſay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I did not poſitivly own his aſſertion. Yet 3. it may ſafely be ſaid that more may be required to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of one then of another, and that its as impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine a Catalogue of truths neceſſary to the Salvation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, as to find out a dial to ſerve all Meridians, or a coat to ſerve the Moon in all her changes, and yet not be impoſſible to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:150121:93"/>
determine Fundamentals properly and ſtrictly ſo called. For clearing of this, it would be conſidered that there be two kinds of truths neceſſary to Salvation, ſome primarly, ſimply, and abſolutely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the explicite belief whereof no adult perſon can be ſaved, and theſe are ſtrictly taken Fundamentals, others are onely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> and Secundarily, as when a point of truth is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be revealed by God, though in it ſelf it be not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, yet in theſe circumſtances a man cannot disbelieve it, or impugn it, and continue therein, without throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon damnation. For to oppugn known truth is a ſin, which without repentance neceſſarily infers damnation. On this account Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſaid that the preciſe number of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truths could not be determined; becauſe one may ſee more of the material objects of Faith to be revealed than another, and ſo more may be neceſſary to the Salvation of one than of another, and conſequently its impoſſible that a certain number for all ſhould be determined, and ſo much alſo is acknowledged by Dr. <hi>Vane, Loſt Sheep cap.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 88. Yet this concludes no impoſſibility of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the number of the firſt kind of neceſſary truths, without the explicite belief whereof no adult perſon may be ſaved, though I neither judge it neceſſary nor expedient to be done by me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the preſent, perhaps alſo an Article of religion may be more clear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly revealed then the Fundamentaly of it, for though it be abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to Salvation that Fundamentals be believed, yet its not abſolutely neceſſary, that every Fundamental be believed, under this reduplication, as a Fundamental. Among other reaſons, why it hath pleaſed the Lord not to reveal the Fundamentality of all Fundamentals as clearly, as the Articles themſelves, this may be one, leſt people reſting on the knowledg of Fundamentals, ſhould be leſs ſolicitous in ſearching after other divine truths; which though not of abſolute neceſſity, yet are very precious. It will be time to anſwer his ſquibs and raillery, from the changes of the Moon, when he has vindicated not only their own Miſſionaries who are known for moſt part to be a company of Apoſtate Runnagado's, but alſo the body of their religion and miſſal from multifarious changes, which ſome have not unfitly reſembled to a beggars coat patched, up, at ſundry times of clouts of many colours.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>how ſhall it be known</hi> (ſaith the Pamphleter <hi>pag</hi> 85.) <hi>that Proteſtants do agree in Fundamentals, if the preciſe number thereof cannot be known?</hi> It might be reply ſufficient to appeal the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:150121:93"/>
to give one inſtance of a Fundamental wherein Proteſtants do not agree? Sure there is no Fundamental, which is not owned by ſome Society of Chriſtians, elſe there ſhould be no true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church in the World, but let the dogmaticalls of all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches in the world be ſearched, there ſhall not one be found about which Proteſtants are not agreed, but upon accurat triall, it may be made appear that its either falſe, or at leaſt not ſimply Neceſſary to Salvation. Conſequently it may be made evident that Proteſtants do agree in Fundamentals without determining the preciſe number of them. Nay the violent oppoſition made to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches by Papiſts and other adverſaries, are no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation that we hold all the Fundamentals, for ſurely if we did deny any Fundamental, our enemies, who wait for our halting, and love to grate upon our ſor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But who ſaid that the number of abſolute Fundamentals cannot be pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Surely never I, learned Proteſtants ſuch as <hi>Crakanthorp, Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> and D<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Taylor</hi> ſpare not to ſay that they are contained in the Apoſtolick Creed; they judge it very probable that the ancient Church ſuppoſed the Fundamentals to be contained in their Creeds, <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick, Nicene, Athanaſian,</hi> and that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> If it be ſo, then ſurely Proteſtants agree in Fundamentals for to all theſe Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant; do ſubſcribe and that in the very ſenſe, wherein the ancient, Church took them. But Romaniſts have added many Fundamentals not contained in theſe Creeds, and altogether unknown to the ancient Church, therefore they diſagree from the ancient Church in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, yea and among themſelves alſo. Can they ſo much as agree, what is that Church into whoſe ſentence faith is to reſolved? I add further if there be ſolidity in that rule laid down by <hi>Edward Fouler</hi> in his deſign of Chriſtianity <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 21. viz. <hi>that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved all Fundamentals, who upon accurat ſearch can ſay that he is ſincerely willing to obey his Creator and Redeemer in all things commanded by him, that he entertains and harbours no luſt in his breaſt, that he heartily endeavours to have a right underſtanding of the Scriptures, to know what doctrins are delivered therein for bettering of his ſoul, and the direction of his life and actions.</hi> I ſay, if this be a ſolid rule, then, certainly, we hold all fundamentals of religion, there being, thorow mercy, many thouſands of ſuch ſerious perſons in the Reformed Churches, who have ſuch a teſtimony in their conſciences. Yet, I deny not,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:150121:94"/>
but this rule has need to be well cautioned, elſe I am afraid that <hi>Arrians, Socinians,</hi> and other blaſphemous Hereticks will be ready to conclude hereupon that they alſo maintain all Fundamentals, and therefore I ſpeak of it only in conjunction with theſe things which went before. To ſhut up all in a word, let all the ſolid rules Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable be taken for trying, who have all the Fundamentals of Faith, and we decline to be tried by none of them. Whereas the Popiſh Church dare not adventure to be tryed but by that one rule, the falſehood whereof has in <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. been clearly proved, and is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly partial. <hi>viz.</hi> that all and only theſe things are to be held for Fundamental, which ſhe defines to be ſuch.</p>

Many of theſe ſuperinduced Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals might be enumerated. Its indeed a fundamental, that Chriſt is the head of the Catholik Church, but who warranted to add the Pope as another head? Its a Fundamental, that Chriſt once offered himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin on the croſs, but who warranted them to add a daily unbloody expiatory ſacrifice in the <hi>Maſs?</hi> Its a Fundamental, that God is Religiouſly to be adored, but who war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted them to add that Images alſo are religiouſly to be adored? Its a Fundamental that God is to be invocated, but who warranted them to invocate Angels or departed Saints? Its a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal that there is an Hell and Heaven, but who warranted them to add a Purgatory for expiation of venial ſins, and the temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to mortals ſins? Its a Fundamental, that God is pleaſed to reward good works with eternal life, but who warranted them to add that good works are meritorious of eternal life? Many more of this kind may be added by which conſequently they deſtroy the true Fundamentals.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:150121:109"/>
And firſt, I muſt remember him of one branch of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he hath not touched, which he will find in <hi>pag.</hi> 129. what Chriſt took in his hands, what he did break and bleſs, that he gave to his Diſciples, and affirm'd to be his body; but it was bread which he took into his hands, which he did break and bleſs; <hi>Ergo,</hi> It was bread which he gave and affirmed to be his body: Now all know, and <hi>Bell.</hi> doth acknowledge it, that the body of Chriſt cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated of bread. Conſequently the propoſition muſt be figurative; both the premiſes are clear in the Series of the context; ought not this Jeſuit either to have been more ſparing in boaſting, or elſe more through in examining the Argument?</p>
                  <p>Next I come to try how ſolidly he hath behaved himſelf in what he hath touched. I aſſerted indeed <hi>pap.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 127. <hi>that theſe words of Chriſt, This is my body,</hi> according to the Romiſh gloſs, would be inexplicable, falſe, and imply a contradiction, and conſequently their gloſs could not be genuine: I am ſo far from being removed from my judgment, by reading this Pamphlet, that the ſhallowneſs of his Anſwers do the more confirm me. And firſt I ſaid it was inexplicable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired Mr. <hi>Demſter</hi> to let me know what Chriſt meant by <hi>hoc, this;</hi> for if he meant either the bread or the accidents of bread, the ſence muſt be figurative; for theſe are not in a proper ſence the body of Chriſt. And by <hi>hoc, this,</hi> Chriſt could not mean his own <hi>body,</hi> it not being yet preſent when <hi>hoc this,</hi> was pronounced; Nor could he mean, <hi>Ens in confuſo, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduum vagum,</hi> or <hi>contentum ſub ſpeciebus;</hi> that is, ſomething under the accidents of bread, Chriſt himſelf knew not what, which are the deſperate ſhifts of Schoolmen. This I ſay, cannot be the meaning, unleſs they come to that height of Blaſphemy, to affirm that Chriſt's underſtanding was clouded with confuſions, ſo that he knew not himſelf what he meant by <hi>hoc, this;</hi> To all this he anſwers, <hi>pag.</hi> 112, 113. <hi>That</hi> hoc, this, <hi>ſignifyed nothing determinately until the last word, or predicate</hi> [my Body] <hi>was pronounced.</hi> A noble Solution forſooth, and worthy of the acumen of a Jeſuit! Doth he not by ſaying that when Chriſt pronounced this, it ſignifyed nothing at all determinately, confirm what I ſay, that their gloſs renders the propoſition of Chriſt inexplicable; for I can put no other
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:150121:110"/>
gloſs upon the words of this Pamphleter, but that neither the Apoſtles, nor yet Chriſt himſelf underſtood what <hi>hoc</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, when it was firſt uttered; it ſignifyed nothing deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately, then it would appear it ſignifyed ſomething, but indeterminately, what can this be, but the <hi>individuum vagum,</hi> that others talk of; that is, in plain Scots, ſomething, but Chriſt himſelf knew not what. Was the mind of our Saviour, in whom are all treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge, ſo clouded? Though it were granted, that the hearer could not underſtand ſo diſtinctly, what were meant by <hi>hoc, this,</hi> until the predicate &amp; whole propoſition were uttered, yet ſure at the 1 ſt utering of the ſubject <hi>hoc,</hi> the ſpeaker himſelf knows as perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what he means by it, as when the whole <hi>propoſition</hi> is uttered. Now the queſtion betwixt <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and us, is, what Chriſt who was the ſpeaker, underſtood by <hi>this,</hi> when he uttered it; Sure it could be nothing, but that which he had in his hand, at the preſent, but at the preſent he had nothing in his hand but real bread, for the body of Chriſt was not ſubſtituted in the place of bread, according to the principles of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiators, <hi>ergo, hoc, this,</hi> could ſignifie nothing but bread, and that determinately, and conſequently the propoſition muſt be figurative. Suppoſe a man holding out a piece of Gold to another, ſhould ſay, this is a <hi>Jacobus,</hi> who could deny, but by <hi>this</hi> at the firſt pronunciation thereof, he did underſtand the piece of Gold? whether he or I do <hi>quibble</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter, others may judge.</p>
                  <p>I added Secondly, <hi>pag.</hi> 128. that according to the Popiſh gloſs, this propoſition of Chriſt's were both falſe, and ſhould imply a manifeſt contradiction. This I confirmed two wayes; Firſt, becauſe a true affirmative propoſition <hi>de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenti</hi> cannot produce its own object, elſe in that inſtant of Nature, wherein the propoſition is conceived before its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as the cauſe before its effect; the propoſition ſhould be true, as is ſuppoſed, and not true, becauſe the object in that inſtant is not. Secondly, becauſe at leaſt in that inſtant of time, wherein the copula of an affirmative propoſition <hi>de praeſenti</hi> is enunciated, the object ought to exiſt. But according to Tranſubſtantiators in that inſtant of time wherein Chriſt pronounced the copula of this propoſition, <hi>This is my body,</hi> Chriſt's body was not in the Sacrament, and
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:150121:110"/>
therefore the propoſition in the ſenſe of Tranſubſtantiators muſt be falſe. This Argument he firſt retorts, <hi>pag.</hi> 113. <hi>Alleadging that this other affirmative propoſition of Chriſt</hi> de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenti, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. <hi>This is my command, that ye love one another, doth produce its own object;</hi> and pag. 115. he adds many more, <hi>viz. let the light be made, let the firmament be made, young man I ſay unto thee, ariſe, I will, be thou healed.</hi> I wonder that with theſe words of God, <hi>fiat coelum,</hi> he did not joyn theſe of the Pope, <hi>Eſto Cardinalis,</hi> whereby his Holineſs, like another Deity, by two words, of a kind of <hi>non ens,</hi> creates a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Yet I muſt take leave to tell him, that in none of theſe examples, is there an inſtance of an affirmative propoſition <hi>de praeſenti</hi> producing its object, meer imperative words, ſuch as <hi>fiat lux, let there be light;</hi> and the reſt mentioned <hi>pag.</hi> 115. are no affirmative propoſitions, but meer commands. Doth God affirm every thing to be which he commands to be? What, a Jeſuite, and not able to diſtinguiſh betwixt one affirmative propoſition, and a word of command? If any of his inſtances ſeem to be to the purpoſe, it's that <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. <hi>This is my command, that ye love one another.</hi> But neither is that an affirmative propoſition <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> producing its object. I hope the Diſciples were bound to love one another before that, conſequently the command of mutual love had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious exiſtence. If therefore it be asked, what Chriſt meant by <hi>hoc, This,</hi> in that propoſition, I do not ſay with the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter, that he meant nothing determinately, till the whole propoſition was uttered, but he meant the command of loving one another, which was in force before he uttered that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and that the following words, that <hi>ye love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> are added but exegetically, that the Diſciples might underſtand, what was the particular command he meant. And truly the Diſciples had as much need of this explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after the prolation of the predicate as of the ſubject. For when he had ſaid, <hi>This is my Commandment,</hi> they had yet been at a loſs what the command was, unleſs he had ſubjoyned this explication. If it be enquired, may not an affirmative propoſition <hi>de praeſenti</hi> be a command <hi>quoad primum ſuum eſſe,</hi> and have its ſelf for its object? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though that were, yet would it not follow that an affirmative propoſition <hi>de praeſenti</hi> is productive of its object; I ſuppoſe Philoſophers
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:150121:111"/>
ſufficiently demonſtrate that it is repugnant to reaſon that a thing ſhould produce it ſelf, at leaſt, as to its firſt being? In that caſe it would only follow that the propoſition were a formal command, or a ſignification of the will of God, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging to obedience; but not that the propoſition ſhould be a command, and yet produce the command; that I ſuppoſe were ſtill a contradiction.</p>
                  <p>As there is no ſolidity in his retortion, ſo neither in his poſitive anſwer which thus he delivers, <hi>The propoſition of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is true in the instant of Nature;</hi> ſed non pro inſtanti Naturae, <hi>but not for the inſtant of Nature, even as to day I may truly affirm what will be to morrow.</hi> If I miſtake not, he ſtill involves himſelf in contradictions. As to day he cannot truly affirm, <hi>de praeſenti</hi> what ſhall only be to morrow, ſo neither can he in this inſtant of Nature truly affirm <hi>de praeſenti</hi> what ſhall only be in the next. When a propoſition for any inſtant, whether of time or nature, affirms that to be <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> which is not in that inſtant, that propoſition is ſurely diſconform to its object, and conſequently falſe. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that may truly be affirmed <hi>de preſenti,</hi> which is not <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> then the propoſition ſhould be both true and falſe; true, and not true, at once. Nor do <hi>I deſtroy all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical knowledge,</hi> as he ignorantly affirms, by denying that an affirmative propoſition <hi>de praeſenti</hi> can be productive of its object. Who beſide him ever affirmed <hi>that all practical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge affirms its object to be before it is?</hi> Were not this indeed to make all practical knowledge to imply a contradiction? Now, whether he or I deſerve his civil Complements of a <hi>Don Quick-Sott,</hi> and whether their figment of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, or the Doctrine of reformed Churches, concerning the ſenſe of this propoſition of Chriſt, be the <hi>Chymer</hi> and <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill of giddy brains,</hi> is remitted to the Judgment of unbyaſſed perſons.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>COncerning the number of Sacraments, I had the more largely inſiſted in my Tenth Paper, becauſe Mr. <hi>Demp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
                     <pb n="441" facs="tcp:150121:111"/>
had Solemnly appealed me to prove the Doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches as to that thing. But how Scabrous a Reply is given by the Pamphleter from <hi>p.</hi> 115. they who indifferently compare both may judge. The enumeration of the pamphleters omiſſions in this one queſtion would draw long, I mention but one, though each of the five Romiſh Sacraments, Confirmation, Pennance, Marriage, extream Unction, and Orders were ſeverally confuted, yet this Ghoſt of Mr. <hi>Dempſters</hi> had not the confidence to examin what was objected againſt any of them.</p>
                  <p>To Supply thoſe defects, he betakes himſelf, as his cuſtome is, to ſome jmpertient clamours. As 1. <hi>That this tenet of two Sacraments and no more, is a fundemental of the Proteſtant Religion.</hi> 2. <hi>that this is peculiar to us, all the reſt of our Tenets being derived from other Hereticks.</hi> 3. <hi>That it was a year before this anſwer to</hi> Mr. <hi>Dempſters, query did appear.</hi> To begin with the laſt of theſe, I anſwer, that my Reply to Mr. <hi>Dempſters</hi> tenth paper was inread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineſs within a moneth, and communicated to ſome friends, but could not be delivered through Mr. <hi>Dempſters</hi> diſappearing. To the firſt of the other two, I anſwer, its a manifeſt falſhood did I not prolixly ſhew that if there be any controverſy in Divinity, wherein an adverſary may wrap himſelf up in Logomachies, this is it. And that as the word Sacrament is explained more or fewer, may be aſſerted.

His gloſs upon <hi>Auſtins gemina, that he meant only two chief Sacraments,</hi> is to dilute, he might as well ſay, there are but two Planets, or that <hi>Jacob</hi> had but two Sons, meaning two chief ones.

I have learned a leſſon from him. Next for <hi>Auſtin, the Pamphleter ſays, he hath all the ſeven Sacraments, becauſe forſooth in one place he gives the name of a Sacrament to one, and in another place to another,</hi> but to pre-occupy that cavil in my Tenth paper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Dempster,</hi> I did advertiſe that <hi>Auſtin</hi> frequently uſes the word Sacrament in a large ſenſe, and attributes it to many things, which neither Papiſts nor we hold for Sacraments, as to the Sign of the Croſs, meat given to Catechumens, yea to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamy, inſomuch that <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de ſac. in gen. cap.</hi> 24. <hi>Sect.

                  <p>Though this Pamphleter lays aſide my definition of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not daring to tell why, yet I will uſe him with more Candour, for <hi>pag.</hi> 120. this definition he inſinuates, <hi>That Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are viſible or ſenſible ſigns of the inviſible grace they produce in the Soul, as Instituted by Chriſt our Lord for ſanctification, and in this ſenſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there be ſeven ſet down in the Goſpel.</hi> Behold the Fox! ſhould he not have ſaid, and no more, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath defined?

It would be ſupererogation to add any more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe five Sacraments, until he have anſwered what I wrote in my tenth paper againſt Mr. <hi>Dempſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But doth not this Pamphleter bring ſome Scriptures for the controverted Sacraments <hi>Pag.</hi> 121. I confeſs he doth, but ſuch as conclude nothing for him, all theſe having been often vindicated by Proteſtants from the detorſion of Romaniſts, yea, ſome of them wer touched in my tenth reply to Mr. <hi>Demſter</hi> yet he ſets down the Scriptures barely, as if they contained <hi>in terminis</hi> his poſition, ſuch is the daring boldneſs of Jeſuites, as if their Dictates and gloſſes upon Scripture were to be received without any reaſon.</p>
                  <p>For Cohfirmation he cites two places, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. he ſhould have ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 17. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. But neither of theſe prove the preſent Romiſh confirmation to be a proper Sacrament; Not the firſt, in which its only ſaid, <hi>Then laid they their hands upon them, i. e.</hi> theſe that believed, <hi>And they received the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is there here any mention of Oyle or of Balſome, which Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth, and the Council of <hi>Florence, in Decreto ad Inſtrust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Armen.</hi> and the Roman Catechiſm, <hi>Part.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>q</hi> 6. affirm to be the matter of this Sacrament, or is there mention of theſe words which the Pope and Catechiſm <hi>q.</hi> 10. call the Form of this Sacrament, <hi>viz. ſigno te ſigno crucis, &amp;c.</hi> Doth not <hi>Eſthius</hi> in 4. <hi>Sent.

In that Scripture there is only mention of impoſition of hands, but in their Confirmation there is no impoſition of hands, (as <hi>Dallaeus</hi> learnedly proves, <hi>de Confirmatione lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.)
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:150121:114"/>
but only an anointing and croſſing the Forehead with the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamated Oyle by the finger of a Biſhop, which can no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be termed Impoſition of hands, then the ſprinkling of water in Baptiſm upon an infant, can be ſo called. Did ever any ancient Father expound theſe words of Anointing and Croſſing with Balſamated Oyle? Are not Romaniſts then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Innovators, who have ſubſtitute a Sacrament of Balſama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Oyle, which hath no veſtige in that, or any other Scripture? Beſides Sacraments are exhibitive of ſanctifying grace. But how can it be proved, that by the Holy Ghoſt which here is ſaid to be received, are meant the ſanctifying Graces, and not the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Gifts of the Spirit, ſuch as the gift of Tongues, Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in the Popiſh Schools paſs under the Name of <hi>gratia gratis data?</hi> Sure theſe <hi>Samaritans</hi> were Baptized, Believed, and received the word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 12. 13, 14. before <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> came down to them, and ſo had the ſanctifying graces of the Spirit, but the Holy Ghoſt, as here ſpoken of, had fallen upon none of them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. Undoubtedly therefore by the Holy Ghoſt here are meant the edifying gifts of the Spirit, and not ſanctifying graces. Was not the falling of the Spirit upon theſe believing <hi>Samaritans,</hi> like the falling of the Spirit on theſe of <hi>Caeſarea, Act.</hi> 10. 44, 45. and theſe <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 6. on whom <hi>Paul</hi> laid his hands, but there ſurely the edifying gifts of the Spirit are meant, for preſently it is added they Propheſied and ſpoke with Tongues. Had it been otherwiſe, how could <hi>Simon Magus</hi> ſo eaſily have diſcerned that they have received the Holy Ghoſt? The ſanctifying graces of the Spirit are not eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible, but edifying gifts, as ſpeaking with Tongues do clearly manifeſt themſelves. But though though it were given that ſome ſanctifying graces had been conferred by the laying on of the hands of the Apoſtles, doth it therefore follow that it was a proper Sacrament? Is every ſenſible ſign by which grace is conferred, a Sacrament? Is not the Spirit given by Prayer, and by Preaching of the Word, which yet are no Sacraments. How great things do Romaniſts aſcribe to their Crucifixes and Holy Water, which yet they make not Sacraments? What ſhould I ſpeak of that Traſh of outward Ceremonies which are added to Baptiſm, Exſufflations, Spittle, Oyle, Salt. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all theſe Sacraments? Doth not <hi>Bell. lib. de Bapt. cap.</hi> 25. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. relate from <hi>Auſtin</hi> of Sanctifying of Catechumens by the Impoſition of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:150121:115"/>

Yet <hi>Soto, Coninck,</hi> and generally the reſt of the Popiſh Doctors deny that to be the Sacrament of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Was not Impoſition of hands in ſolemn benedictions, and ancient Jewiſh rite, as may appear by <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. 18, 19, 23. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 32. and ſo not firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitut. by Jeſus. Laſtly, ſome practices of the Apoſtles make not alwayes a perpetual ſtanding Rule for the Church. But more for the vindication of that Scripture, together with a confutation of all <hi>Bellarmins</hi> cavils, may be ſeen in <hi>Dallaeus Diſp. de Confirm. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11, 12. as for the <hi>other Scripture</hi> for <hi>Confirmation,</hi> from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21, 22. there is mention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of eſtabliſhing and anointing, but its manifeſt from <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. it was with no material oyle, but by the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo much is acknowledged by <hi>Ethius</hi> on the place. Is not Chriſt ſaid to be anointed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. <hi>Iſa</hi> 61. 1. dare he ſay it is with material oyle? Is there not a parallel Scripture, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. <hi>The anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es you all things.</hi> But ſure that's a myſtical Unction by the Spirit, for it abides, is Internal, and teaches all things, which, without too violent a <hi>Catachreſis,</hi> cannot be aſcribed to Romiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For Pennance he cites other two Scriptures,</hi> Joh. 20. 23. <hi>whoſe Sins ye ſhall forgive, are forgiven;</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>And many of them that Believed, came confeſſing their Deeds.</hi> Both theſe places are ſufficiently vindicated by <hi>Fulk</hi> againſt the Rhemiſts. In a word, it ſhall be enough to me to ſay that theſe Scriptures prove a Miniſterial power of abſolution, and that diſtreſſed Conſciences may disburden their Spirits, by laying open their ſins to faithful Paſtors, and in cafe of publick Scandal, publick confeſſion of Sin ſhould be made. All theſe Proteſtants do grant; but that every one is bound neceſſarily to reveal all his particular ſins, how ſecret ſoever, by auricular confeſſion to a Prieſt, and that he hath power to impoſe proper ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Divine Juſtice, as Romaniſts teach concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Pennance. Neither theſe nor any other Scriptures hold out.

Did I not alſo plainly tell that both theſe Scriptures treat of an Unction in reference to a miraculous healing of diſeaſed perſons? Ought not this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to have been refuted, if he had intended to Satisfy thoſe that are judicious? Many arguments might be heaped up to confirm the interpretation I have given. I hint but at a few things. And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that of <hi>Mark</hi> treats not of a Sacramental Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as is acknowledged by the moſt eminent Champions for the Romiſh cauſe already cited, to whom <hi>Greg. de Val. Dominicus a Soto, Ruardus</hi> and many others may be added, and who will deny it, muſt anſwer both <hi>Bellarmins</hi> arguments, and alſo theſe brought by our Divines. Therefore neither is there any Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>James.</hi> For any, who with indifferency of Spirit, will compare the two places, will find them exactly parallel, and this the Jeſuit <hi>Maldonat on Mark c.</hi> 6. hath ſufficiently proved, albeit his heat for the Romiſh intereſt made him falſly to jmagine a Sacramental inſtitution, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Secondly</hi> Sacraments are not <hi>principally</hi> inſtituted for the body, but chiefly at leaſt, if not only for the <hi>ſoul.</hi> But both theſe Unctions, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. are chiefly for the body, In <hi>Mark</hi> 6. mention is only made of bodily cure, In <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. the healing of the body is both firſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely Spoken of, and forgiveneſs of ſin only in the ſecond place, and alſo conditionally, therefore in neither place have we a proper Sacrament. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Romiſh greaſy Unction is only adminiſtred to thoſe that are deſperatly Sick, of whoſe recovery there is no hope, but the Vnction Spoken of by <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> are not at all reſtricted to theſe, therefore the preſent Romiſh Unction is different from them both. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if <hi>James</hi> words are to be underſtood of Extream Unction, why are Elders in the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:150121:116"/>
plural appointed to be called for, ſeeing only one can officiat in that matter. <hi>Lastly,</hi> not to repeat what was objected againſt this in my laſt, is it probable that if this had been a Sacrament inſtituted by Chriſt, that the Fathers in the firſt three Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would have made no mention thereof, how comes it that we hear not of it either in the conſtitutions under the Name of <hi>Clement,</hi> or in <hi>Denys,</hi> whom they hold for the <hi>Areopagit</hi> in his <hi>lib. de Hierarch.</hi> had they not convenient opportunity of it? Indeed <hi>Denys</hi> ſpeaks of an anointing the Dead, but of Unction of the Sick he hath no mention. That it was wholly unknown to the ancient Church is learnedly proven by <hi>Dallaeus de extrem. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nct. lib.</hi> 2. who alſo examins all the Cavills of Romaniſts for this pretended Sacrament.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether Proteſtant Churches do grant that the Viſible Church was not always preſerved, and that for</hi> 1400. <hi>years before</hi> Luther, <hi>Popery was the only prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT may ſeem ſtrange that I ſhould be put to Debate this queſtion, having ſo often appealed Mr. <hi>Dempſter</hi> to try the Truth of Religion, not only by its conformity with the holy Scriptures, but alſo with the Faith of the ancient Church. But ſo evil natur'd is this Ghoſt of Mr. <hi>Dempſter,</hi> that as if I were too narrow a Mark for his reviling genius, he ſpends one entire Section, from <hi>pag.</hi> 125. <hi>to</hi> 129. in a calumnious repreſentation of the Proteſtant Churches, <hi>as if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more ancient Proteſtants had affirmed that the Viſible Church had periſhed from the days of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and that the only prevailing Religion for</hi> 1400. <hi>years before</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>had been Popery.</hi> For this end he has ſcraped together out of his common Place-Books a multitude of broken ſhreds from Proteſtant Authors, from which he deduces ſundry abſurd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, of which the Authors never once dreamed; how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate muſt the Romiſh Cauſe be, when they cannot impugne us, but by miſrepreſenting us, and charging upon us Tenets which they know we condemn? Yea, though we diſown them, yet they will ſtill impoſe them upon us. When they thus ſport with their own Shadows, do they not gallantly confute the Proteſtant Religion?</p>
               <p>To aſſoyle therefore the Proteſtant Churches in this matter, and to demonſtrate that our Adverſaries play but the Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, theſe enſuing obſervations may be noticed.</p>
               <p>And firſt, the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches is not to be meaſured by the ſentiments of private Doctors, of what fame ſoever, but by their ſolemn Confeſſions of Faith, long ago publiſhed to the world, purpoſely to prevent ſuch miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations. The harmony whereof, in the ſubſtantials of
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:150121:117"/>
Faith penned by men of ſo many different Nations, under no common juriſdiction, and of ſo different complexions as to other things, is next to a miracle, and may be Sufficient, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the pretended neceſſity of an infallible viſible judge. But in this preſent debate the Adverſary brings not one Sentence out of theſe confeſſions, but only from the writings of private Doctors, yea, ſome of them not only of ſmall account, but alſo diſowned by the more judicious, as being no Proteſtants at all. Would Romaniſts be content that we hold the Sentiments of their moſt famous Doctors, Such as <hi>Cajetan, Durandus, Gerſon, Ferus,</hi> &amp;c. much more of these who have apoſtatized from them for the Doctrine of their Church. Why then deal they with us by other meaſures then they would be dealt with themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly much leſs are Broken ſhreds from Proteſtant au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, violently detorted contray to their known judgment in other their writings to be taken for the ſtandard of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion. Yet ſuch are moſt of the Teſtimonies which <hi>Breerly Knot. H. T.</hi> &amp;c. and this filching Pamphleter (who licks up their excrements) doe make uſe of in this queſtion. <hi>Did Dr. John Whyte, Whitaker, Chillingworth, Calvin, Iewel, Chemnitus, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiſts, &amp;c. maintain that there were none that profeſſed the Religion of Proteſtants from the dayes of the Apoſtles intill Luther, or that Popery was the only Prevailing Religion for</hi> 1400. <hi>years before Luther?</hi> Nay on the contrary, doth not <hi>Dr. John Whyte</hi> in is way to the Church <hi>ſect.</hi> 17. Peremptorily affirm, <hi>that this faith which we profeſſe hath ſucceſſively continued in all ages ſince Chriſt, and was never interrupted, not ſo much as one year, moneth or day.</hi> Doth not <hi>Chillingworth c.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 9. when he is pondering ſuch Teſtimonies of <hi>Jewel, Naper, Brocard, &amp;c.</hi> as are cited by the Pamphleter, declar they never meant that the viſible Church had totally failed, but only from its purity? Doth not <hi>Whitaker, Controv.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>q.</hi> 7. expreſly affirm <hi>That we can prove out of the Fathers, our Doctrine to have been in the Church in all theſe ancient ages?</hi> Doth he not a little after charge <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as belying <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the <hi>Centuriſts,</hi> as if when they charged the Fathers with theſe errors mentioned by this Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leter, <hi>viz. Limbo, freewill, and merit of good works,</hi> as if I ſay they had charged theſe on all the Fathers, and on all the Church; none of which they ever meant, ſaith <hi>Whitaker.</hi> Sure I am <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius, pag.</hi> 200<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at leaſt in that <hi>Edit.</hi> I have <hi>Genev.</hi> 1641. ſays not as the Pamphleter alleadges, <hi>viz.</hi> that moſt of the Fathers did
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:150121:118"/>
avouch Invocation of Saints. But on the contrary affirm, <hi>pag.</hi> 634. <hi>that for</hi> 350. years after Chriſt, there was no Invocation of Saints <hi>in publica praxi Eccleſiae,</hi> and that the firſt riſe of it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 370. in <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Baſils</hi> Panegyricks, by Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical Apoſtrophes, and that alſo with an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo far were they from maintaining it to be an article of Faith. It were tedious to go through all, among all the teſtimonies cited by the Pamphleter, there will not one be found, who affirm that Popery was the prevalent Religion for 1400 years before <hi>Luther,</hi> except <hi>Sebaſtian Frank,</hi> whom Dr. <hi>Francis Whyte,</hi> in the defence of Dr. <hi>John Whyte</hi> againſt <hi>T. W. pag.</hi> 324. declares to be an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt, an unlearned, malapert not ſpur; <hi>Chemnitius</hi> as the ſame Author teſtifies, calls him <hi>hominem petulantem &amp; indoctum.</hi> Did ever Proteſtants acknowledge that the body of the preſent Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Religion was received by the ancient Church? ſuch as half Communions, picturing and adoring Images of the Trinity, the whole preſent worſhip of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the performing the worſhip of God in an unknown Tongue, the neceſſity of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible viſible judge, the prohibiting of reading Scriptures in vulgar Tongues, Indulgences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the neceſſity of auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; the neceſſity of the Prieſts intention to make Sacraments effectual, the Popes Supremacy and Soveraignty over Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who is the Proteſtant that ever acknowledged theſe things to have been ever received in the Catholick Church? I profeſs I never read of him, nor knew him, nor I believe ſhall he ever be found. Whereas <hi>Jewel</hi> ſaid, <hi>That Truth was not known untill the Preaching of</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Zuinglius, that muſt ſurely be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Francis Whyte</hi> obſerves, <hi>lib. cit. pag.</hi> 267. for <hi>Jewel</hi> gave a moſt ſolemn challenge to Papiſts at <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſs to make out one Article of their Religion out of one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for 600. years after Chriſt, which challenge he proſecuted againſt <hi>Harding.</hi> What Dr. <hi>John White ſaith in defence of his way, cap.</hi> 37. <hi>That Popery was a Leproſie breeding in the Church ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, that there was no viſible company appearing in the world free from it,</hi> makes nothing againſt what is ſaid. Nay, in theſe words he diſtinguiſhes betwixt the Church and that Leproſie of Popery, and by ſaying that it was a Leproſie in the Church, he affirms the exiſtence of both. The meaning of the Doctor only was, that in theſe latter times, wherein Popiſh errors and ſuperſtition ſpread ſo far in this Weſtern part of the World, though God
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:150121:118"/>
with the reſt, even as thoſe ſeven thouſand in the days of <hi>Elias</hi> did with the reſt of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> when ſome Fathers are charged with ſome errors, (which is all that theſe teſtimonies amount to) it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that all the Fathers were ſmitten therewith. Though <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> erred in the Rebaptization, though <hi>Tertullian</hi> did Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize, Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> Arrianize, many <hi>Aſiaticks</hi> eſpouſe the <hi>Quarto Deciman</hi> opinion, <hi>Origen</hi> maintain poſitions which were juſtly anathematiz'd by the fifth general Council, yet I hope all the Fathers, much leſs the whole Church, was not leavened with theſe errors. Made I it not appear in my 9. paper againſt Mr. <hi>Dempster, pag.</hi> 194. 195. that none are more profuſe in cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Fathers then Romaniſts. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpares not to ſay, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Beat.

                  </gap>e Armies of Fathers, All the Fathers with one voice affirm, ſaith <hi>Melchior Canus lib.</hi> 7. <hi>loc. com. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>That the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>was conceived in Original Sin. Chryſoſt. Euſeb. Ambroſe, Auſtin,</hi> &amp;c. and as Dr. <hi>James</hi> obſerves, ſome bring 200. others, 300. Fathers to confirm this opinion, yet what ſaith that Biſhop of the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of all theſe, <hi>Cum nullus Sanctorum contravenerit, infirmum tamen ex omnium authoritate argumentum ducitur, quin potius contrarium &amp; probabiliter &amp; pie in Eccleſia defenditur, i. e.</hi> Its but a weak argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is drawn from the Authority of all the Fathers, yea, the contrary, notwithſtanding their ſuffrages, may be piouſly defended. Are theſe the men who challenge us for undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fathers, who put ſuch contempt upon them? In very deed they regard no Fathers, further then they can ſerve their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Both Scriptures and Fathers muſt ſtoop to the authority
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:150121:119"/>
of the preſent Church of Rome, that is the Pope.</p>
               <p>How many baſtard Fathers have they legitimated? How many true Fathers have they caſtrated? Hence is that obſerve of Dr. <hi>Don,</hi> in his <hi>pſeudo-Martyr cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 30. according to Romaniſts the Scripture is a Divin Law, the writings or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of Fathers a ſubdivin Law, but the decretalls of Popes a ſuperdivin Law, whereunto Scripturs, Councils and Fathers muſt bend and bow. Yet I muſt do them right, they have one evaſion, according to which they do wrong to no Father, for if the Pope prohibit the writings of ſuch an Author, he ceaſes to be a Father, he is but as <hi>Gretſer</hi> the Jeſuit phraſeth it, <hi>Vitricus,</hi> a ſtep Father. Nor need Fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of this uſage, ſeeing the Pope uſurps the like Authority upon the Scripturs of God. Neither ſhall Fathers be Fathers, nor Scriptures be Scriptures, except it pleaſe the Pope, Is not this that man of ſin that exalts himſelf above all that is called God?</p>
               <p>I deny not but ſome Proteſtants, may have been too raſh in their cenſurs of Fathers, perhaps not fully penetrating the ſcope of Fathers, or not diſtinguiſhing betwixt their genuine and ſuppoſititious writings, have ſuppoſed them to favour errors, from which others; yea and ſomtimes the ſame authors alſo upon better adviſment have vindicated them. As I cannot in this wholly juſtify the <hi>Magdeburgion Centuriſts,</hi> ſo I cannot but notice how this <hi>Pamphleter</hi> hath either through ignorance or malice injured them. He brings in the <hi>Centuriſts reprehending Cyprian, Origen and Tertul: in the third Century, and Nazianzen in the fourth, for teaching Peters primacy, and again reprehending Cyprian, for owning the ſacrifice of the Maſs, and generally confeſſing that the Fathers of the third age did witneſs the invocation of Saints,</hi> It's true the <hi>Magdeburgians. Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>tit. de inclinatione Doctrinae,</hi> ſeem to ſay ſomthing of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Tertull,</hi> as favouring primacy, yet <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>tit. de primatu,</hi> they not only affirm, but poſitively undertake to demonſtrate, that the head-ſhip and ſupremacy of the Biſhop, or Church of Rome was acknowledged by none in that age, and particularly they ſay, that <hi>Origen</hi> never aſſerted the primacy of the Biſhop of Rome, and bring in <hi>Cyprian</hi> giving luculent teſtimonies againſt it in his debates with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> Biſhops of Rome. Yea and they explain thoſe other expreſſions
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:150121:119"/>
of <hi>Cyprian</hi> which ſeemed to favour primacy, as making no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for that ſupremacy which Romaniſts now plead for. So likewiſe <hi>Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>tit. de primatu. Pag.</hi> 314. <hi>edit. Baſil.</hi> 1624. They deny that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ever aſſerted any primacy of the Biſhop of Rome but <hi>primatum ordinis.</hi> Concerning the Sacrifice of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Maſs, the <hi>Magdeburgians, Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 42.

               <p>But yet the Pamphleter objects <hi>that the Centuriſts affirm that Irenaeus, Clement, and all the Doctors of the ſecond age did admit free will even in ſpiritual actions, to whom both they and Abraham Scultet</hi> (ſays he) <hi>adds Cyprian, Theophilus, Tertul, Origen, Clemens of Alexandria, Juſtin, Athenagoras, Tatianus,</hi> &amp;c. But this Pamphleter diſcovers that either he has never read the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiſts</hi> and <hi>Scultet,</hi> or that he is moſt perfidious in his citations.

Hence to the clamorous cavil, where was our Religion before <hi>Luther,</hi> may ſolidly be replyed, It was, as to eſſentialls at leaſt, where ever God had a viſible Church, and conſequently not only in the <hi>Greek, Syrian, Aegyptian,</hi> and <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Churches, which remain viſible Churches, and more pure then the Roman, but alſo our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was preſerved in the Roman Church, ſhe likewiſe being a viſible Church, though a moſt impure one; I ſay our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was preſerved in her, as the true Religion was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Jewiſh Church, when ſhe was defaced with groſs Idolatry. Neither ſhould this ſeem ſtrange eſpecially ſeeing many thouſands in the Roman Church then groaned for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as appeared by the conjunction of ſo many with <hi>Luther</hi> upon his firſt appearance. I further add that we are not obliged to grant the ſame of the Roman Church at this time, which we grant of her before the reformation. For ſurely ſince the reformation, the Church of Rome is greatly changed to the worſe, as Dr. <hi>Feild</hi> in the place laſt cited, and <hi>

Conſider ſixthly, that though it be granted that there were errors in the Church, yet it doth not follow, <hi>that the whole body of Popery, as now it is, was acknowledged to be always there, as this impudent</hi> Pamphleter <hi>would infer. Pag.</hi> 136. <hi>that all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in Pope Pius confeſſion of Faith were owned by Councils and Fathers of the firſt three ages.</hi> Yea, and he is bold to ſay, <hi>that heerupon I am bound to turn Papiſt.</hi> Let any man ſqueez his whole Book, and if he have evicted that noe Father or ancient Council, maintained the whole Syſteme of the preſent Romiſh Faith, I will be a Romaniſt? I cannot but have their Religion in greater abhorrency, when I ſee that they have no other way to ſupport it, but by manifeſt calumnies, and ſuch inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential diſcourſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome Fathers erred in ſome things as is acknowledged both by Romaniſts and Proteſtants, therefore the whole preſent Romiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religion was owned by Councils and Fathers in the firſt three ages, a moſt ludibrious incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. The miſtery of iniquity wrought but by degrees, the Papacy came never to its full ſubſiſtency till the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> there be particulars there enacted as Articles of Faith which never were ſo before. Verily Popery is nothing but a complex of innovations brought in by peece meal. What is the ſcope of <hi>Flaccus Illiricus,</hi> his <hi>Catalogus teſtium veritatis,</hi> but to give an account of the witneſſes of truth in all ages ſince Chriſt, as any Popiſh error did creep in and appear in the Church?

What ſhould I ſpeak of <hi>Morney</hi>'s <hi>Mysterium iniquitatis. of Voetius his deſperata cauſa papatus,</hi> of <hi>Mortons appeal, Prideaux de viſibilitate Ecclefiae, Moulin de novitate Papiſmi,</hi> &amp;c. All which and many more have made it their work to demonſtrate the perpetuity of that Religion which Proteſtants profeſs, notwithſtanding what ever corruptions in the Church, and have convicted the Romiſh Church of manifold innovations. And therefore in my tenth Paper againſt Mr. <hi>Demſter,</hi> I deſired him to ſhew me where the preſent Romiſh Religion was before the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> But this the Phamphleter never touches, as if he were deaf upon that Eare. <hi>He only brings ſome broken teſtimonies from this or that ancient, to give ſome plauſible colour ſometime to one, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time</hi>

               <p>From theſe ſix conſiderations, I ſuppoſe it may evidently appear, how ſophiſtically this Pamphleter and others of his Fellows do miſrepreſent Proteſtants as to this matter, I ſhall ſhut up this diſcourſe with two teſtimonies, one from learned Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> another from <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> The judgment of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as to this caſe is excellently delivered by Mr. <hi>Hooker. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>of Eccleſ. pol. pag.</hi> 86. <hi>Papiſts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>aske us where our Religion did lurk before</hi> Mr. <hi>Luther, as if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we were of opinion that Luther did erect a new Church.

               <p>Page, 130. He has two reflexions upon my appeal to the Fathers of the firſt three Centuries, wherein he imagins he has diſcovered ſome acutneſs. But they are but ſpongious bulruſhes and already confuted, yet I ſhall mention them. 1. <hi>he enquires why I appeal to the Faith of the Church in the firſt three ages more then in after times? Was her Doctrin then purer, her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition more Flouriſhing, or her Authority then greater?</hi> He may find the ſame objection anſwered in my <hi>Paper.</hi> 7. <hi>against</hi> Mr. <hi>Demp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter from pag.</hi> 130. <hi>to</hi> 135. <hi>and paper 10th. pag.</hi> 215. 216. It ſeems this man is not acquainted with the writings of the more Learned Jeſuits, for <hi>Greg. de Val. in</hi> 3. <hi>part. diſp.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>punct.</hi> 6. diſputes this queſtion at length. Whither they who lived next to the Apoſtles did not <hi>eo plenius divina mysteria noſſe,</hi> underſtand more fully Divine Myſteries then others of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and concludes the affimative tracing the foot ſteps of <hi>Aquinas</hi> their Angelike Doctor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now therefore only in a word I ſay that though the Churches Authority was not then great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor her condition, as to outward proſperity ſo flouriſhing, yet then her Doctrin was more pure and ſhe flouriſhed more in Holineſs, then had ſhe <hi>aureos Sacerdotes,</hi> though, <hi>ligneos calices.</hi>
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:150121:123"/>
Is it any wonder that a ſtream run purer, the nearer to the Fountain? When hath the truth of Doctrin, the beauty of holineſs, ſhined more, then when the Church has been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in the Furnace of fiery preſecution? Told I not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>paper</hi> 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 216. that I never intended to reſtrict this enquiry to thoſe ages alone, only pleading to begin at them, but this, Romaniſts would willingly decline. All their ſeeming advantages are from the more corrupt times of the Church. They aske, where our Church was before <hi>Luther,</hi> which has been often ſufficiently cleared. But we aske at them, where their Religion was in the firſt three ages, and much lower alſo, which never was, yea never will be ſufficiently cleared. Take their Religion, as it is ſet forth by <hi>Pius quartus</hi> confeſſion of Faith, and in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and let all the Jeſuits upon the face of the earth, find it out in the firſt three ages of Chriſtianity, if they can. How far the broken fragments, which this Pamphleter filches from his Fellows, are from performing this work, ſhall (I hope) be ſeen in <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reflexion is, <hi>If I appeal to the Faith of the Church of the first three ages then I muſt acknowledge one infallible viſible Judge.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I deny the ſequel, was it to any repreſentative of the firſt three ages which I did appeal? Is it not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that in the firſt three ages from that Council at <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſalem, Act.</hi> 15. there was no general Council which together with a Pope is made by this Pamphleter the infallible Judge? Was it not to the Faith of the diffuſive Catholike Church, to which I did appeal, to which neither Papiſt nor Proteſtant aſcribes a juridical power? But the diffuſive Church has a promiſe of perpetuity, and Conſequently that the eſſentialls of Faith ſhall be preſerved in her. If therefore the Faith of the ancient Catholike Church may be known, by it the Faith of the preſent Church may be tryed. Yet I ever made it but a ſecundary rule, the holy Scriptures being the chief teſt, but of this I treated more at large, <hi>Paper</hi> 7. <hi>Pag.</hi> 231, 232. 233. 234.</p>

<pb n="466" facs="tcp:150121:124"/>
ſpoke or thought ſo. Papiſts are injurious to the truth not only by addition, but alſo by ſubſtraction. Do they not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract the cup in the Sacrament, Do they not ſubſtract the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance both of Bread and Wine, leaving only a ſpecter of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents to remain in the Sacramental Symbols? Do they not deny the perſpicuity of Scriptures, and that all ſins of their own nature merit eternal damnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all which they hold the negative, and we the affirmative. <hi>The obſerve which</hi> he ſubjoyns <hi>that all cheif Hereſies for most part conſiſted in negatives.</hi> Is ludibrious? all, for the moſt part, is all, and not all. But have not groſs Hereticks maintained poſitive errors as <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees duo principia, Tritheits</hi> three Gods, the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> that himſelf was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Biſhop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is he not ſo ridiculous in reckoning the negatives of Hereticks that as would ſeem he could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt an affirmative and a negative? Among negative Hereticks he reckons the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> whoſe Hereſy conſiſted in a poſitive aſcribing two perſons to Chriſt, and the <hi>Marcionits</hi> for maintaining that Baptiſm ſhould be reiterated. Is not rebaptization a poſitive? Papiſts maintain ſeven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould others maintain twice ſeven, were they not Heretical? Papiſts add Apocrypha Books to the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If others added the evangells of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to the New Teſtament were they not Hereticks, Papiſts ſay <hi>dulia</hi> ſhould be given to Saints, ſhould others aſſert the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs of <hi>Latria</hi> to them, were they not Hereticks. There may therefore be Hereſy in poſitives, But what though all Hereticks maintained negatives, which yet is falſe, doth it therefore follow that all who maintain negatives are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks? Is a Syllogiſm in <hi>2da figura ex omnibus affirmantibus</hi> good? Though it were ſo, the Papiſts could not clear themſelves from Hereſy, for they alſo differ from us in negatives, This only in paſſing to ſhew the ludibrious quibling of Sophiſticating Jeſuits.</p>

                     <hi>The Truth of the Religion of Proteſtants evicted, by the Conformity thereof with the faith of the Primitive Church, in the firſt three Ages, and the falſhood of the preſent Romiſh Religion from the diſagreement thereof with the Faith of theſe Ages.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere being but one Faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5. or one true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, which undoubtedly was conſerved, in as great purity by the Church, in the firſt three Ages, as in any other time, conſequently among the many pretenders to Religion in theſe days, their Religion muſt only be true which agreeth in eſſentials with the Faith of the Catholick Church in thoſe Ages, and that ſurely muſt be a falſe Religion, which is diſcrepant in Eſſentials from that primitive Faith. Whereupon I ſubſume, but ſo it is, that the Religion of Proteſtants doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in Eſſentials with the Faith of the Catholick Church in thoſe times, and the preſent Romiſh Religion doth certainly diſagree. Therefore the Religion of Proteſtants is the true Chriſtian Religion, and the Popiſh Religion is falſe and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The evidence of the firſt propoſition is ſo clear, that the Pamphleter in a peculiar Section from <hi>pag.</hi> 139. labours to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the preſent Romiſh Faith by ſome abuſive Pretexts of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, as if the Fathers of thoſe Ages did clearly ſpeak for them, and againſt Proteſtants in all the chief controverted points. It remains therefore, that I prove the Aſſumption. In order to which, I only premiſe, that a Religion may differ from that ancient Faith in Eſſentials, or in points neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> Either by denying ſome Articles of faith, which ſhe held as neceſſary, or by coyning others as neceſſary, which ſhe held not. This premiſed,</p>
               <p>For evicting the conformity of our Religion, as to all Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, with the Faith of the Catholick Church in the firſt ages, it may

                  </gap>de to Mr. <hi>Dempster, pag.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 54. to inſtance one Eſſential of Faith, wherein we differ from the Chriſtian Church in thoſe Ages, that is, to pitch upon one Article held as abſolutely neceſſary by the Catholick Church of thoſe times, and denied by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, or one Article, which the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches hold as abſolutely neceſſary, and thoſe ancient Churches held not. If we may judge of what other Romaniſts can ſay, as to this matter, by the ten Inſtances which the Pamphleter from <hi>pag.</hi> 139. has ſcraped together from their common Place Books. I hope the enſuing examination of them ſhall diſcover more the conſonancy of our Religion with the ancient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and the diſſonancy of the Romiſh Religion. Or if we meaſure the Eſſentials of the ancient Chriſtian Faith, by the ancient Creeds and Confeſſion of Faith, theſe being drawn up as teſts to diſtinguiſh them of the Church from others, which, as is ſuppoſed by learned Divines, would not anſwer their end, if they did not contain the Articles, which the Church in thoſe days held as neceſſary. Then ſurely the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches do agree with the ancient Church in all Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Faith. For all the Reformed Churches do cordially own all the ancient Creeds, and Confeſſions of the Primitive Churches, not only in the firſt three ages, but alſo much lower, ſuch as the Apoſtolick, the <hi>Antiochian, Nicen, Conſtantinopolitan, Athanaſian,</hi> as alſo theſe of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> neither have the Proteſtant Churches made a ſuper-addition of new eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Articles unknown to the Primitive Church in thoſe times. Nay, ſo clear are Reformed Churches in this matter, that we appeal all the Enemies of the Reformed Religion, to try our conformity to the ancient Chriſtian Church in all Eſſentials with the moſt rigid diſcuſs that is imaginable.</p>
               <p>But on the other hand, the diſconformity of the preſent Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Faith, with that ancient Catholick Faith, may be obvious to any, by comparing thoſe ancient Creeds with the preſent Popiſh Creed of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, in which a multitude of Articles are ſuper-added, ſuch as the Septenary number of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the propitiatory Sacrifice of the Maſs, Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, Purgatory, Innovation of Saints, Adoration of Images and Reliques, the power of Indulgences, the Magiſterial Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of the Church and Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> over the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:150121:125"/>
Church, yea, and all the Articles of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> are concluded as neceſſary to Salvation. Which certainly are not to be found in any of the ancient Creeds; Nay the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Creed ſubjoyns theſe to the Conſtantinopolitan Creed, as ſuperadded thereto, as is to be ſeen <hi>in vitâ Pij 4ti</hi> ſet forth by <hi>Onupbrius,</hi> and in the Confeſſion annexed to, <hi>H. T.</hi> his Manual, as a teſt of the Romiſh Religion, therefore the preſent Romiſh Religion is not the true ancient Chriſtian Religion, but a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of innovations tyrannically impoſed upon Conſciences of People.</p>
               <p>Yet becauſe this impoſtor pitches upon <hi>ten Articles</hi> contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted betwixt us and Romaniſts, wherein he affirms, <hi>that the Fathers of the firſt three ages ſpeake clearly againſt Protestants,</hi> it may contribute both for the further clearing of the truth, and diſcovering of Roman perfidy, to trace him throw theſe particulars.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>HIs firſt inſtance, <hi>Pag.</hi> 139. is concerning <hi>the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, as being,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the moſt principal thing.</hi> Its indeed the moſt principal thing with the Popes Paraſits, hence, <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de concil. cap.</hi> 17. <hi>Greg. de Val. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>de anal. fid. cap.</hi> 7. and other Jeſuits give the Pope a ſupremacy over the whole Catholick Church, yea and over general Councils, as Pope <hi>Boniface the</hi> 8. <hi>extrav. commun. unam Sanctam,</hi> had defined <hi>that ſubjection to the Pope, is of neceſſity to Salvation to every Creature.</hi> But this is as oppoſit to the faith of the ancient Church as Eaſt to Weſt. Had this been the faith of the Church in thoſe times, then it had been defined, according to the Pamphleters Principle, by the infallible viſible judge of thoſe times. Why then does he not produce ſuch a definition among his citations? Doth not the world know that in thoſe three ages there was not one Oecumenick Council, except that at <hi>Jeruſalem, Act.</hi> 15. unleſs with <hi>Binius</hi> and the Ordinary gloſs thoſe other three Conventions of the Apoſtles, <hi>Act. cap.</hi> 1. 6. 21. be alſo held for Oecumenick Councils. But ſure it is,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:150121:126"/>
that none of all theſe made any definition for the Popes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, Conſequently there was no infallible viſible judge in thoſe times to make ſuch a definition. I did always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that the ſeat of the pretended Romiſh infallibility had been the ſeat of their ſupremacy. How then is it, that though Pope and Council were inſinuated by this <hi>Pamphleter Sect.</hi> 3. to be the ſeat of infallibility joyntly. Yet now the Pope alone is made the ſeat of ſupremacy? Is he alone ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream but not infallible? Is their Church bound to obey and believe a fallible Pope teaching lyes and blaſphemies, as having ſupremacy over them, though not infallibility? Had the Churches in thoſe three ages believed the Popes ſupremacy as neceſſary to Salvation, would <hi>Polycrates</hi> and the holy Aſiatick Fathers in the ſecond Century, have withſtood the Pope ſo reſolutly in the matter of Eaſter, as is witneſſed by, <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 22? Would <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſo holy a Father, and Martyr with the Affrican Fathers in the third <hi>Century</hi> ſo vehemently have oppoſed Pope <hi>Stepbanus</hi> in the matter of rebaptization, as is acknowledged by <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 7? Would he have ſo zealouſly oppoſed appeals, to Rome as he does, <hi>Epist.</hi> 55. or cenſured Popes ſo ſharply for admitting them, which is to ſtrike at the root of this pretended ſupremacy? Would the <hi>fourth Oecumenick Council at Chalcedon, Act.</hi> 15. <hi>can.</hi> 28. and <hi>Act.</hi> 16. in which were 630. Fathers have defined in <hi>foro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorio,</hi> after debate with the legats of Rome, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Conſtantinople ſhould have equal priviledges with the Biſhop of Rome?

Would the ſame African Fathers, among whom <hi>Auſtin</hi> was one, in the ſixth Council of Carthage, have ſo ſtoutly oppoſed appeals to Rome, as <hi>Barron. ad annum.</hi> 419. cannot deny, though both he and <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 25. endeavour, by ſome ſlight evaſions to palliat the matter, the falſhood whereof is luculently evicted by <hi>Chamier.

Is not aſhamed to condemn the proceedings of that ancient African Council againſt the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> Such is the reſpect of Romaniſts to Antiquity, when it croſſes their intereſt.

Would <hi>Greg.</hi> 600. Yeares after Chriſt. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 32. 34. 38. 39. have condemned the Title of univerſal Biſhop, as a Title of Novelty, error, blaſphemy, the univerſal poyſon of the Church, contrary to the Ancient Canons, contrary to <hi>Peter,</hi> and to God himſelf, a Title which none of his predeceſſors aſſumed, and who ever did preſume to challenge it, was a for runner of the Antichriſt. Its a manifeſt forgery contrary to all truth, which, <hi>Bellarmin. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 31. and other Romaniſts uſe to elude thoſe luculent teſtimonies of <hi>Greg.</hi> as if he had only condemned the title of univerſal Biſhop in that ſenſe wherein <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did claim it, <hi>Namely,</hi> ſo as he alone ſhould be Biſhop, and other Biſhops ſhould not at all be Biſhops, but his Vicars. Whereas <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> never claimed that Title in any other ſenſe, then it is this day uſed by the Biſhops of Rome, for. 1. the oriental Biſhops conſented with <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> that he ſhould be termed univerſal Biſhop, but its hardly credible, that they would all have conſented that themſelves ſhould be degraded. But ſecondly Romiſh Authors, particularlarly <hi>Platina</hi> in the Life of <hi>Boniface</hi> the third doth teſtify, that the ſame dignity which <hi>John</hi> did effect, <hi>Boniface</hi> obtained from that bloody Murtherer <hi>Phocas,</hi> not without much ado, <hi>magna tamen contentione,</hi> ſays <hi>Platina.</hi> Doth not the oppoſition which the Ancient Brittiſh and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Churches made to <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, to <hi>Laurentius</hi> and <hi>Mellitus,</hi> ſent over to <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Greg.</hi> the firſt in the matter of Eaſter and celebration of Baptiſm, of which ſee, <hi>Bede.

Nor do we deny, if a Preacher not having a Bible with him, ſhould come to ſome <hi>American</hi> Countrys and Preach the Goſpel, that they were bound to believe, yet it would not follow that the truths which they believed were not contained in Scripture.

And whereas he ſaid, Hereticks were to be convicted by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he ſpeaks not of Traditions altogether unwritten, but of Scriptural Doctrins, which had been tranſmitted, done in the Apoſtolick Churches to that time. And it is in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Hereticks who either did deny the Scriptures, or mutilate them, or acknowledged not their perfection. Though againſt ſuch Traditions be improven, It follows not that all Articles of Faith are not contained in Scripture.

                  <p>There remains nothing as to the matter of Tradition, but that he charges <hi>the Fathers as receiving the Scripture only upon Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> Yet for this he alleadges no proof, and therefore it may be rejected as a Jeſuitiſm.

ſtate of the queſtion betwixt Romaniſts and us, which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary deceitfully ſhuns to unfold. We then confeſs that in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is a lively repreſentation, and a thankfull commemoration of the Sacrifice of Chriſt offered upon the Croſs, ſo that this Sacrament may be termed an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Euchariſtick and commemorative Sacrifice, or as others ſpeak latreutical and objective.

                  <p>But its not names we ſtand upon, and therfore I affirm that though Fathers did offen uſe the word <hi>Sacrifice</hi> concerning the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, yet they meant only an eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtick and commemorable Sacrifice, not proper and expiatory. This has been largly demonſtrated by many. I will hint at a few conſiderations, which I hope may Satisfie thoſe that are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately wilfull to adhere to a preconceived opinion.</p>
                  <p>And 1. the Fathers ſaid that they did Sacrifice to God, bread and win in the Euchariſt, ſo <hi>Irenaeus lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. <hi>Cyprian Serm. de opere &amp; Eleemoſynis,</hi> and <hi>epiſt.</hi> 63. and <hi>Auſtin epiſt.</hi> 122. yea and the compyler of a part of the Miſſal (for its like a beggars

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Fathers doe clearly expound themſelves to mean nothing elſe, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> who as often terms the Sacrament of the Supper a Sacrifice as any, expounds his meaning moſt clearly <hi>Hom.</hi> 17. <hi>in Heb. we offer up,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>The ſame Sacrifice which Chriſt offered,</hi> then he Subjoyns by way of Expoſition, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> as the Euchariſt, ſo alſo Baptiſm was called by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a Sacrifice, the moſt of the Fathers, <hi>plerique antiquorum,</hi> if we may credit <hi>Melchior Canus lib.</hi> 12. <hi>loc. com. c.</hi> 13. <hi>p.</hi> 680. expound that of the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>There remains no more Sacrifice for ſin,</hi> of Baptiſm.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> as fathers ſay that Chriſt is Sacrificed in the euchariſt ſo are they found ſaying that he dyes and Suffers in that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <hi>Sixly,</hi> this truth is ſo luculent, that it hath extorted confeſſions from eminent Doctors of the Romiſh Church, that the Sacrament of the Supper is called a Sacrifice, becauſe in it the Sacrifice of Chriſt on the croſſe is commemorated, ſo <hi>Lombard lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ſent. diſt.</hi> 12. <hi>Aquinas. part.</hi> 3. <hi>queſt.</hi> 83. <hi>art.</hi> 1. <hi>Liranus in heb.</hi> 10. <hi>Piche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, diſſert. de Miſſa.

are only to be underſtood of Euchariſtick, commemorative, and Symbolick Sacrifices, which might be confirmed by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular arguments from the ſeveral Authors, but I hope the premiſed conſiderations may ſuffice.

                  <p>THe Pamphleter in his fourth Inſtance, ſaith, <hi>that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants deny the real preſence and Tranſubstantiation.</hi> And toward the cloſe of this fourth Inſtance, <hi>Pag.</hi> 145. he would ſneakingly inſinuate, <hi>that their half Communions</hi> (which are ſo palpable an innovation, that their own Authors cannot deny it) <hi>had been approven by the Ancient Church.</hi> To this laſt I ſhall have a more fit occaſion to ſpeak in the firſt appendix to this, <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. And therefore at the time ſhall only examin that of Tranſubſtantiation. We deny not the real preſence, nay, we affirm that Chriſt is really exhibited to believers in the uſe of the Sacrament. That which we deny is a Tranſubſtantiated preſence, ſo as the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine are deſtroyed, a ſpecter of accidents without a Subject, remaining, and the body and blood of Chriſt being ſubſtituted under the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. In this we and not Romaniſts are conſonant to the Faith of the Ancient Church.

                     <hi>Euchariſt, conſiſting of two things, the terren, and the heavenly.</hi> Then in the Euchariſt two things are exhibited to believers, the terren, <hi>viz,</hi> Bread and Wine, and the Heavenly, the body and blood of Chriſt. And therefore the uſual <hi>Objection</hi> which the <hi>Pamphleter</hi> takes out of the ſame <hi>cap. of Irenaeus where the Father concluds againſt Hereticks that Jeſus is the Son of the maker of the World, becauſe that bread upon which thanks is given, is the body of the Lord, and that cup his blood,</hi> makes nothing for Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, Nay it diſtroys it, Bread cannot be the body of Chriſt nor the cup his blood in a proper ſenſe, but in a figurative, and the force of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> argument appears to be this, he that inſtituted the creatures of God as ſacred and exhibitive Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols of his body and blood, muſt be the Son of God, Chriſt did ſo, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

But if Romiſh Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation were true, <hi>Tertull,</hi> could never have uſed a more unhappy argument againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> for if there be no real bread in the Sacrament, but a Phantaſm of accidents without a ſubject, this had rather given advantage to <hi>Marcion,</hi> who affirmed Chriſt to have a Phantaſtical body. Here I cannot but notice the prevarication of the Pamphleter, he mentions only theſe words of <hi>Tertull, the Bread taken and diſtributed he made his body,</hi> and then crys out, <hi>what more cleer for Tranſubſtantiation?</hi> But had he not mutilated <hi>Tertullians</hi> words, it would have appeared nothing could be more clear to overturn Tranſubſtantiation, for preſently <hi>Tertull,</hi> thus explains himſelf, <hi>hoc est, figur a corporis mei,</hi> that is, <hi>this is, the figure of my Body.</hi> Yea, <hi>Beatus, Rhenanus, in admon. de Tertul. dogm. reckons,</hi> this as one of <hi>Tertullians</hi> ſentiments, that the body of Chriſt is only figuratively in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.</p>
                  <p>By this alſo may be cleared, what the Phamphleter <hi>objects out of Ignatius Epiſt. ad Smyrnenſes that the Saturnian Hereticks did not admit of Euchariſts and oblations, becauſe they do not confeſs the Euchariſt to be our Saviours Fleſh.</hi> For as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>I add another teſtimony of <hi>Tertullian lib. de anima. cap.</hi> 17. <hi>the ſenſes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are not deceived about their own objects, leſt thereby ſomething of advantage might be yeelded to Hereticks, making but a Phantaſm of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. But according to the tenet of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiators the ſenſes of all the World are ludified, with <hi>Tertullian</hi> accords <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 76. calls the Bread the body of Chriſt and the Wine his blood, which were a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt falſhood, if not figuratively underſtood. So likewiſe <hi>Origen in Math.</hi> 15. <hi>that which is ſanctified by the word of God and Prayer, according to the material part of it, goes into the belly, and is ſent into the draught.</hi> I deſire to know by a Romaniſt, what is this material part of the Sacrament which goes into the draught, if the ſubſtance of bread do not remain? when therefore <hi>Origen ſaith we eat and drink the body and blood of the Lord, in the place objected by the Pamphleter,</hi> he can only be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of a Symbolical and Myſtical Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>With thoſe Fathers of the firſt three ages, theſe of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times do agree as appears by, <hi>Theod, dial.</hi> 1. where he ſays <hi>that by the bleſſing of conſecration, the nature of the elements is not changed, but grace added unto nature,</hi>

                  <p>That the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine are deſtroyed in the Euchariſt, and the body and blood of Chriſt are ſubſtituted in their place, was no eſſential of Faith in the firſt three ages.

                  <p>But did not the Ancient Church pray for the dead? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its granted ſhe did, but not for a liberation from torments, under which ſhe ſuppoſed them to be preſently ſmarting, as do Romaniſts, and therefore from theſe Prayers, nothing can be concluded for Purgatory. The Ancient Church in their Prayers for the dead did pray for Martyrs, Apoſtles, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Prophets, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and for all the faithful, as appears from <hi>Epiphanius haereſ.</hi> 75. and from the Liturgies that go under the names of <hi>James,</hi> and of <hi>Chryſoſtom, in bib. pat. tom.</hi> 2. <hi>graeco—latin,</hi> and from the Liturgy of the Churches of <hi>Egypt,</hi> attributed to <hi>Baſil, Greg, Nazianzen,</hi> and <hi>Cyril, in bib. pat. tom.</hi> 6. <hi>edit.</hi> 4. <hi>Cyprian likewiſe lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 5. affirms, <hi>they offered for the Martyrs who had received Palmes and Crowns.</hi> Many more teſtimonies may be brought, but I ſum up all in that teſtimony of <hi>Auſtin lib. de cura pro mortuis cap.</hi> 4. who affirms that <hi>Prayers were made for all that dyed in the Catholick Faith.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore the Ancient Church prayed for thoſe, who by the confeſſion of all were not in torment, but in a bleſſed ſtate, the ſcope of their Prayers was not for deliverance from the torments of Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>If any aske, for what then did they pray for the dead, <hi>Bell.</hi> is conſtrained to afford us an anſwer, for when he had objected to himſelf, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Purg. cap.</hi> 5. how in the <hi>Maſs</hi> for the dead they pray, <hi>that the Souls of the faithful may be delivered from the pains of Hell, from the deep lake, from the mouth of the Lyon,</hi> he <hi>anſwers,</hi> that although the Souls of the faithful at their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular judgment have received a ſentence, whereby they are
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:150121:135"/>
delivered from Hell, yet there remains a general judgment, where they are to receive a ſolemn ſentence both as to Soul and Body, and that the Prayers of the Miſſal do relate to that laſt ſentence of the great day, the ſame may be ſaid to have been the ſcope of the Prayers of the ancient Church.</p>
                  <p>But yet further, to clear that the Prayers of the ancient Church had no reference to Purgatory. It would be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that among ancient Chriſtians there were divers Errors concerning the ſtate of the departed, now juſtly diſowned both by Proteſtants and Papiſts, which might have given occaſion to theſe Prayers, as firſt, many of them were of opinion, that though all the Souls of the Faithful were <hi>in requie,</hi> in a bleſſed reſt, yet they were not admitted to the Beatifick Viſion before the day of Judgment. Hence <hi>Sixtus Senenſis, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Bibl. Annot.</hi> 345. to prove that many in the ancient Church were ſmitten with this Error, he not only adduces teſtimonies from ſeveral particular Authors, ſuch as <hi>Irenaeus, Juſtin, Tertul, Origen, Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Prudentius, Ambroſe, &amp;c.</hi> but alſo the form of Prayer for the dead, in <hi>James Liturgy.</hi> 2. Many were of opinion, that all were to paſs through a fire of Purgatory at the great day. Yea, 3dly, ſome were of opinion, that by the Prayers of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the pains of the Damned were eaſed, among whom were <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Prudentius, &amp;c.</hi> of which ſee <hi>Sixtus Senenſis, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Annot.</hi> 47. I ſhould not willingly mention theſe miſtakes and errors of Fathers, did not the importunity of Romaniſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain me to diſcover the miſapplications which are made of their Prayers to Purgatory. But generally they believed, that the Souls of the faithful at the preſent were <hi>in requie,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Tertul. lib. de Patientia,</hi> accounteth it an injury to Chriſt to judge, that the Souls of departed Saints are in a ſtate to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, theſe miſtakes of Ancients, being now through the mercy of God cleared, there is no reaſon to admit the ſuperſtructure built thereupon.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but add what learned <hi>Dallee</hi> hath obſerved, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de paenis &amp; ſatisfact. cap.</hi> 2. that among all the Teſtimonies which <hi>Bell.</hi> hath muſtered up for Prayers for the Dead, there is none brought from the real writings of any Fathers, who died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginning of the 3d Century, and therefore judiciouſly concludes, that ſeeing there is no mention of them, either by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Prophets, or by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, or by the Fathers, who immediately ſucceeded to them, as <hi>Ignatius, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:150121:136"/>
or <hi>Juſtin Marlyr,</hi> that upon the forementioned accounts they have been introduced into the Church towards the end of the 2d Century, but without any intuition to Purgatory. Had they been then deſigned for Purgatory, how came it that the Fathers never once gave this as the reaſon of theſe Prayers? When <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was demanded by <hi>Aerius,</hi> for what end Prayers were put up for the Dead, it had been eaſie to have anſwered, that it was for the deliverance of Souls out of Purgatory? But he brings other reaſons, and has nothing to that purpoſe, which is a clear demonſtration, that he was not of the preſent Romiſh Faith concerning Purgatory. And ſurely its built upon moſt abſurd Principles, ſuch as 1. the diſtinction of ſins Venial and Mortal, as if ſome ſins of their own nature did not deſerve everlaſting puniſhment. 2dly, That when God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives ſin, he forgives not all the puniſhment thereof. 3dly, That Chriſt has not ſatisfied Juſtice fully for our ſins, ſeeing we muſt in part ſatisfy our ſelves for them.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BEfore I deſiſt from this enquiry after Romiſh Novelties, the Adverſary muſt be advertiſed, that though he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Ten foregoing Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (in which I hope his failour by this time may be manifeſt) yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had he not done his work. For ſhe hath Innovated groſly in many other particulars, whereof I ſhall preſent here another Decad, which the Catholick Church of the firſt Three Ages did never approve.</p>
                  <p>Inſtance Firſt, the preſent Romiſh Church holds the Books of <hi>Maccabees, Eccleſiasticus, Tobit, Judith, Baruch, Wiſdom, for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scriptures, and Anathematizes them who do otherwiſe.</hi> So the <hi>Council of Trent, Seſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Decret.</hi> 1. But the Church in the firſt three Ages held no ſuch thing, as is evident from the Catalogues of <hi>Melito, in Euſeb. Hiſt. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. Of <hi>Origen</hi> in <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 25. Of <hi>Athan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Sinopſi.</hi> and of the Council of <hi>Laodicea Can.</hi> 59.

Is not only conſtrained to yield us <hi>Hierom,</hi> but alſo <hi>cap.</hi> 20. grants that <hi>Melito, Epiph. Ruffinus,</hi> and <hi>Hilary</hi> do follow the Jewiſh Church in the Canon of Scripture. Now ſure it is that the Jewiſh Church did never acknowledge the forecited Books for Authentick Scriptures. I appeal all the Antiquaries of <hi>Rome</hi> to bring me one evidence from the firſt three Centuries of their <hi>Trent</hi> Canon of Scriptures. This was objected by me to Mr. <hi>Dempſter, pag.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 171. but yet I am waiting a Reply.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt Pretext for the Ancient Pedigree of the <hi>Trent</hi> Canon, including the forecited Apocriphal Books, is, that of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:150121:146"/>
                     <hi>Becan</hi> the Jeſuite, <hi>In Compend. Manual. Controv. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>qu.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>received is from Pope</hi> Eugenius 4. <hi>in the Council of</hi> Florence, <hi>and</hi> Eugenius <hi>from Pope</hi> Gelaſius <hi>in a Roman Council of his time,</hi> Gelaſius <hi>from</hi> Auguſtine, Auguſtine <hi>from the Third Council of</hi> Carthage, <hi>and the Council of</hi> Carthage <hi>from</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>the Firſt, who ſaith,</hi> Becan <hi>lived Anno</hi> 402.</p>
                  <p>But this is ſuch a Fallacious Story, as ambitious men of baſe Extract are apt to forge to make their deſcent to be eſteemed honourable; For firſt, it's ſo noturly evident and proven by ſo many, that theſe late meetings at <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> were no le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate General Councils, that I ſhould hold it loſt time to inſiſt in probation thereof. Secondly, that Canon of Scripture attributed to the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> ſeems to be ſuppoſititious, ſeeing there is no mention of it, either in the Hiſtory of that Council written by <hi>Silveſter Sguropulus,</hi> who was preſent thereat or in the Tomes of the Councils, ſet forth by the Authority of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> 5. <hi>Anno</hi> 1612. or in the Edition of <hi>Binnius, Anno</hi> 1618. Yea, Dr. <hi>Coſin</hi> in his Scholaſtical Hiſtory, <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>Num.</hi> 159. and 160. obſerves that it is not to be found in any of the Editions of the large Tomes of the Councils by <hi>Pet. Crab<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> &amp;c. The firſt mention we have thereof being in <hi>Caranza</hi>'s Epitome of the Councils. It is a ſtrong ſuſpition of Forgery, when more is in the Epitome, then in the large Volums of the Councils. Nay further, that whole inſtruction to the <hi>Armenians,</hi> which is ſaid to be given by Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> 4. in the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> whereof <hi>Caranza</hi> makes his Catalogue of the Books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be one Article, is likewiſe queſtioned, ſeeing it is dated in the Year 1439. 10. <hi>Kal. December,</hi> five months after the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Council, for it had been diſſolved in the Month of <hi>July</hi> proceeding. Thirdly, its a large leap which <hi>Becan</hi> makes from <hi>Eugenius</hi> and the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> unto <hi>Gelaſius</hi> the firſt, and his Roman Council, near about a 1000. years, this is a great hiatus and gape in the Pedegree. Fourthly, that Decree of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> with his Roman Council of Seventy Biſhops, as alſo <hi>Innocent</hi> the firſt his Decretal to <hi>Exuperius,</hi> looks to be ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious, and the rather, ſeeing there was no mention of them till <hi>Iſidorus Mercator</hi> began to vent his Sophiſtical wares 300. years after the Death of <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> and 400 after the Death of <hi>Innocentius.</hi> Who would ſee more to prove the Forgery of both, may peruſe Dr. <hi>Coſins</hi> Scholaſt.

Fifthly, I have already ſhewed <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Fol.</hi> 1. that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Auſtin,</hi> nor the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> ever meant that theſe Books were ſtrictly Canonical, that is, given by Divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be a publick rule to the Church, for confirming Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, though they might be read in the Church, for a more ample inſtruction how to lead a regular courſe of Life. <hi>Auſtin lib.</hi> 18. <hi>de civ. dei cap.</hi> 36. expreſly diſtinguiſhes the Books of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> from theſe that are ſtrictly canonical.

Thirdly, did the <hi>preſidency in Oecumenick Councils belong to Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>alone?</hi> Can any Ancient Canon of Council, Oecumenick, or provincial, to this purpoſe be alleadged? In the <hi>Nicen</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> was not preſent, Neither did his Legats preſide, elſe how came it that <hi>Hoſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duba</hi> did ſubſcribe before them? Its a bold allegation contrary to all antiquity that <hi>Hoſius was the Biſhop of Romes Legat. Euſeb. Sozom. Theodoret</hi> mention only two of his <hi>Legats, Vitus or Victor,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius,</hi> Presbiters. Neither doth <hi>Hoſius</hi> ſubſcribe as <hi>Legat</hi> but only as Biſhop of <hi>Corduba.</hi> That <hi>Hoſius</hi> preſided in the Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> (which Romaniſts hold as <hi>Oecumenick)</hi> is clear from the Council. Nor can Romaniſts deny but <hi>Nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> preſided in the firſt <hi>Oecumenick</hi> Council held in that place. Did not <hi>Cyril</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> preſide in the <hi>Epheſin</hi> Council? Nor did he thus meerly as <hi>Legat</hi> from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> though indeed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Synod, he did repreſent the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> even as <hi>Flavianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Philippi,</hi> did the place of <hi>Rufus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> for afterwards the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſent three <hi>Legats</hi> to the Council, <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Projectus</hi> Biſhops, and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus</hi> a Presbiter without any mention of <hi>Cyril</hi> in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, yet S. <hi>Cyril</hi> ſtill continued preſes. In the other <hi>Epheſin, Synod,</hi> which likewiſe was only declared illegitimate, becauſe of its unjuſt proceedings, <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was preſes. But this was not charged as a treſpaſs on that Council that the preſidency was given to <hi>Dioſcorus.</hi> In the fifth <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick</hi> Council <hi>Vigilius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> did not preſide, but the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whether <hi>Mennas</hi> or <hi>Eutychius</hi> is not needful here to be diſputed. By this (I ſuppoſe) may be clear that the preſidency in <hi>Oecumenick</hi> Councils was not ſolely appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, was it allowed in primitive times <hi>that appeals ſhould be made from Oecumenick Synods to the Biſhop of Rome?</hi> Sure I am St. <hi>Cyprian Epiſt.</hi> 55. concerning the caſe of <hi>Fortunatus</hi> and <hi>Faeliciſſimus</hi> could not endure that the Biſhop of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:150121:153"/>
advantage him, as if this Canon did prohibit only tranſmarine appeals to be made by Presbiters, But not by Biſhops, for in the Greek edition of this Canan which is the 31. in <hi>Zonaras</hi> his collection of the Canons of <hi>Carthage,</hi> after mention is made of Presbiters, its added <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, as the like hath been often ſtatuted concerning Biſhops. And beſides the ſixth Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> upon a long debate with three Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> pleading for appeals, decreed that no appeals be made to <hi>Rome,</hi> either by Biſhop, or Presbiter and convicted the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> of falſhood pretending a <hi>Nicen</hi> Canon for appeals to <hi>Rome.</hi> Yea, Pope <hi>Damaſus in Epiſt. ad Theoph. &amp; Anyſ.</hi> (which is the fifth among <hi>Ambroſe Epiſtles,</hi> or Pope <hi>Syricius,</hi> whom others will have to be the Author of that <hi>Epiſtle)</hi> confeſſes he cannot judge in the caſe of <hi>Bonoſus,</hi> the Synod of <hi>Capua</hi> (which yet was not <hi>Oecumenical)</hi> having paſſed a previous ſentence therein. The cavils of Romaniſts whereby they would perſwade the World that the right of appeals was acknowledged Anciently to belong to the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> might eaſily be confuted, Did I not ſtudy to avoide prolixity.</p>
                  <p>That which is moſt ſpeciouſly objected is the <hi>fift Canon of the Sardican Council,</hi> but to forbear to reſume all the anſwers made by Proteſtant Authors, let it ſuffice to Advertiſe the Reader, that the Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> was no <hi>Oecumenick</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, elſe it ſhould be reckoned as the ſecond next the <hi>Nicen,</hi> which it never was, and ſure it is, that the Oriental Biſhops would not aſſemble with the occidental, but departed thence to <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> as teſtifies <hi>Socrates lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently could make no Canons obligative to the univerſal Church. Hence <hi>Zonaras</hi> expounding that very Canon, affirms that it only warrants appeals to be made to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by thoſe that were ſubject to the Patriarchat of <hi>Rome,</hi> as many of the Weſtern Churches at that time were, which afterward became ſubject to the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> This may be illuſtrated by a parallel Canon of a Council, truely <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical, viz,</hi> of <hi>Chelcedon,</hi> in favours of the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> for <hi>Can.</hi> 17. that Biſhop is made judge of all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies among Biſhops. Were this to be underſtood univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf ſhould be ſubject to the Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> But <hi>Zonaras,</hi> though a Greek, yet
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:150121:153"/>
in expounding this other Canon, acknowledges that albeit no reſtriction be expreſſed in the Canon it ſelf, it is to be limited to thoſe who were ſubject to the Patriarchat of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> leſt encroachment ſhould be made on other <hi>Sees,</hi> Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by parity of Reaſon, the Canon of <hi>Sardica</hi> (which was no <hi>Oecumenick</hi> Council) muſt be limited to thoſe that were ſubject to the Patriarchat of <hi>Rome.</hi> And ſo much the rather, ſeeing the <hi>African</hi> Fathers profeſſed they knew no ſuch decree of any Council, warranting appeals from them to <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof ſo many Learned Fathers, no fewer then 217. among whom was S. <hi>Augustin</hi> could not have been ignorant, had there been ſuch a decree of an <hi>Oecumenick</hi> Council.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, that the primitive Church aſcribed not <hi>infallibility to the Biſhop of Rome,</hi> may appear from the contradictions he met with from the Fathers of the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Churches, the teſtimonies which this Phamphleter alleadged, for an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible viſible Judge have been diſcuſſed, <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> claimes <hi>a ſuperiority over Princes, in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> So did not the Ancient Church. <hi>Super Imperatorem</hi> (ſaid <hi>Optatus lib.</hi> 3. <hi>non est niſi ſolus Deus, qui ſecit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratorem,</hi> and <hi>Tertul. in Apol. cap.</hi> 30. <hi>Imperatores in ſolius Dei ſunt poteſtate, a quo ſunt ſecundi, poſt quem primi ante omnes, &amp; ſuper omnes Deos &amp; homines,</hi> to this alſo I ſpoke <hi>Pap.</hi> 8. againſt Mr. <hi>Demſter Pag.</hi> 172. but have got no reply, Yea, Jeſuits would be exempting all the Clergy from the juriſdiction of Princes, Hence <hi>Bell. lib. de cler. cap.</hi> 28. <hi>non poſſunt à magiſtratu politico puniri, vel ullo modo trahi ad magiſtratus ſaecularis tribunal.</hi> If you ask what they hold in caſe one of their Clergy become guilty of <hi>Laeſ-Majeſty, Endemon</hi> the Jeſuit and <hi>Simancha</hi> as cited by <hi>Davenant, determin quaeſt.</hi> 17. Anſwer, That it is an unſuppoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble caſe, <hi>in regard they are not ſubject to Princes.</hi> Which is diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trally repugnant both to Scripture, and Antiquity. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1 <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the Higher Powers.</hi> Every Soul, that is, ſaith, St. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> Whether he be Evangeliſt, Prophet, or Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, the <hi>Popes of Rome have now laid aſide Preaching,</hi> which is the Principal function of Paſtors, ſo did not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Biſhops of Rome,</hi> as may appear by the yet extant Sermons of <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Greg.</hi> Yea <hi>Roffenſis cont. Luth. art.</hi> 25. <hi>Fol.</hi> 248. <hi>edit. Antwerp.</hi> 1545. confeſſes that the Ancient Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi>

did by Sermons inſtruct the people, though the preſent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome, aliis preſſi negotijs regnent ſolum, non paſcant,</hi> being taken up with other affaires, only reign, but have not leaſure to Preach.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, was the <hi>power of canonization of new Saints, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated in the firſt three Centuries to the Biſhops of Rome?</hi> The firſt whom <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de beat. Sanct. cap.</hi> 8. could alleadge, to have exerciſed this act of canonization, was Pope <hi>Leo the third,</hi> who lived about the end of the eight Century. By theſe particulars, to which many more might be added, it may appear that the Popedome it ſelf is but a bundle of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
                  <p>In place of a ninth Inſtance I appeal Romaniſts to ſhew from the firſt three Centuries, their <hi>Florentin</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> Doctrine, <hi>ſuſpending the efficacy of Sacraments from the intention of the Prieſt,</hi> as it is expounded by <hi>Bell.

In oppoſition to <hi>Gatharinus,</hi> though this was one of the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections moved againſt Mr. <hi>Demſter,</hi> yet I have not found a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Antiquity brought by the Pamphleter, to juſtify the Romiſh Doctrin in this thing.</p>
                  <p>Inſtance tenth, and laſt (not to rake longer in the puddle of Romiſh innovations) ſhall be <hi>the impoſed neceſſity of a celibat on the Romiſh Clergy,</hi> So manifeſt a Novelty that <hi>Pol.

                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Pamphleters <hi>impertinent Citations from</hi> Juſtin Martyr, <hi>together with a new Catalogue of Hereſies, falſly charged on Proteſtants, briefly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Pamphleter <hi>Pag.</hi> 156. pitches on <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> as if from him <hi>he could prove the preſent Romiſh Religion,</hi> yet cannot find a veſtige in him of their infallible viſible Judge, of their Popes ſupremacy, of their adoration of Images, or Relicts, of the half communion, of their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, canonical Authority of Apocryphal Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed <hi>Justin</hi> gives an account of the Chriſtian Religion in his days, in oppoſition both to <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi> Seeing therefore the <hi>Pamphleter</hi> hath pitched upon him particularly, I appeale not only ſuch <hi>an ignorant Plagiary as this perſon,</hi> but all the induſtrious Antiquaries of the <hi>Romiſh Party,</hi> to try if in <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> the complex of the preſent <hi>Tridentin Faith</hi> can be found. If they can demonſtrate it, I faith fully promiſe to turn a Herauld of their Religion. If not, which themſelves know to be impoſſible for them to do, let them ceaſe to abuſe ſimple Souls, as if their Religion were the Religion of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and of Ancient Fathers.</p>
                  <p>But hath the <hi>Pamphleter</hi> made any new diſcoveries from <hi>Juſtin Martyr?</hi> Not at all. Only he has filched four <hi>trivial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections from Bell.</hi> which conclude nothing againſt Proteſtants. The <hi>Firſt is concerning free-will.</hi> All that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſays as to this, we do admit, for he neither aſſerts that man does that which is ſpiritually good without grace, nor that the efficacy
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:150121:156"/>
of grace does depend on mans will. Of this I have ſpoken ſufficiently <hi>cap.</hi> 7. in the examination of the <hi>Pamphleters</hi> eighth <hi>Inſtance.</hi> The <hi>ſecond is concerning merit,</hi> but <hi>Juſtin</hi> only aſſerts <hi>their is a reward for the Righteous,</hi> from which an argment to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per merit is wholly inconſequent, ſeeing their is <hi>a reward of grace, as well as of debt.</hi> Concerning this alſo, ſee what hath been ſaid <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Inſtance.</hi> 9. The <hi>third is of the efficacy of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> concerning which we likewiſe grant Sacraments to be exhibitive ſigns and ſeals, but <hi>Juſtin</hi> hath nothing of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh <hi>opus operatum.</hi> The <hi>fourth is of the Euchariſt,</hi> concerning which, we likewiſe admit all that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſays, viz. <hi>that the bread and wine in the Euchariſt are not common bread and wine, being conſecrated by Divine inſtitution,</hi> and ſo may be truly called <hi>the body and blood of Chriſt,</hi> as ſigns uſually receive the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the thing ſignified. But does <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſay, as Romaniſts, that the ſubſtance of bread and wine is deſtroyed, and the phyſical body and blood of Chriſt ſubſtituted under thoſe accidents of <hi>bread and wine?</hi> The fiction of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> was not hatched in <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi> days. Thus the <hi>Pamphleters</hi> boaſts concerning <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> have ſoon evaniſhed into Froath. Yet though <hi>Juſtin</hi> had dogmatized in all theſe particulars, as do Romaniſts, it would not follow that he had approven the whole Syſtem of the preſent Romiſh Faith, In which many more errors are engroſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 158. 159. he patches up again <hi>a Catalogue of Hereſies</hi> which he charges on Proteſtants, wherein he diſcovers ſo much ignorance, unfaithfullneſs and indiſcretion, that I ſhall paſs them with an overly touch.</p>
                  <p>And firſt he charges us, <hi>with the error of Simon Magus, ſaying that men are not ſaved by good works, apud Iren. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. Anſwer, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> denyed the neceſſity of good works, which we conſtantly affirm, only we deny good works to be properly meritorious of eternal Life, which was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as Hereſy by any, but late Romaniſts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly he charges us, as ſaying <hi>with Cerinthus that Children may be ſaved without Baptiſm, apud Epiph. haereſ.</hi> 8. But <hi>Epiph. in haereſ.</hi> 8. hath no ſuch thing for there he treats <hi>de Epicur.</hi> Indeed <hi>haereſ.</hi> 28. he treats of the <hi>Cerinthians,</hi> but is ſo far from imputing that error to them, that when any of their number dyed, they Baptized a living perſon for the dead. Juſtifying
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:150121:157"/>
that practiſe from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 29. There be other Hereticks who deny Baptiſm to be a ſtanding ordinance of Chriſt, as <hi>Manichees, Seleucians</hi> and <hi>Henricians apud Aug. haereſ.</hi> 16. <hi>&amp; haereſ.</hi> 59. (with whom <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> joyn iſſue) who are all condemned by Proteſtants, as may be ſeen in <hi>Voſs de Bapt. diſp.</hi> 7. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. Had the Ancient Church held Baptiſm abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, would they have delayed it ſo long? would they in many places limited it to Eaſter and Pentecoſt? could it be but in the intervals many behoved to dye without Baptiſm? See <hi>Socrates Hiſt. Eccleſ. lib.</hi> 5. 21. Would the Church have expoſed them to ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of periſhing Eternally? yea many Popiſh Authors deny the abſolute neceſſity of it, of whom Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> giveth a large account <hi>appeal. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſays he, <hi>with Plotinians we affirm that God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſomethings impoſſible, apud Epiph.</hi> But tells not where. I find one <hi>Plotinus</hi> noted by a <hi>Castro de haereſ. lib.</hi> 14. <hi>tit virginitas,</hi> for Heterodoxy concerning the ſtate of virginity, but as to a poſſibility of keeping the commands of God, he ſpeaks noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him. In what ſenſe God commands things impoſſible I have expounded <hi>cap.</hi> 7. in the examination of the <hi>Pamphleters Instance</hi> 10. and ſhew the conformity of our Doctrine herein with the Ancient Church, and the opoſite Doctrine of Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts to be <hi>Pelagianiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he ſays, <hi>with Manichees apud Aug. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cont. Faustum Manichaeum we pull down Altars.</hi> Anſw. the Altars againſt which <hi>Fau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tus</hi> exclaimes are Communion Tables which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. But St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> takes occaſion thereby to clear two truths which Romaniſts oppoſe, one, that they in the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion celebrate no proper Sacrifice <hi>ſed memoriam peracti Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificii.</hi> Another that they worſhip departed Saints only with that worſhip of Love and Society, <hi>quo coluntur in hoc vita ſancti Homines,</hi> wherewith Saints in this Life are Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, he ſays, <hi>with Donatists, we hold the Baptiſm of Chriſt and John were the ſame in Aug. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cont. lit. Petil. cap.</hi> 32. <hi>and</hi> 34. Anſw. <hi>Petilian</hi> ſaid <hi>John</hi> only gave water, Chriſt the Spirit, and the Holy Ghoſt fire, he denyed that by <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm the Holy Ghoſt was given at all, the contrary whereof is maintained by Proteſtants. It was really
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:150121:157"/>
exhibitive of grace, though the grace was not Originally from <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ſixthly, he objects <hi>of our denying with the Aerians the Fasts of the Church, and Prayers for the dead,</hi> he had ſaid before <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>Pag.</hi> 99. and accordingly was confuted, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, he ſays, <hi>we with Julian forbid the uſe of Images, and ſign of the croſs, apud Sozom. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. <hi>and Euſeb. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. who may not here ſee this <hi>Pamphleter</hi> Scratches up his Citations implicitly from others, for <hi>Euſeb.</hi> neither does nor could relate ſuch a thing of <hi>Julian,</hi> being dead before <hi>Julian</hi> came to the Empire. Yea, <hi>Julian</hi> was ſo far from being an enemy to Image worſhip, that <hi>Spondan, ad annum</hi> 362. <hi>n.</hi> 6. ſhews how <hi>Julian</hi> endeavoured to engage Chriſtians to worſhip the Images of his Heatheniſh Idols. And <hi>Nazianz. or at.</hi> 3. calls him <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianum.</hi> As for us we do not ſimply condemn the uſe of Images, and Croſſes, but adoration of them, as hath been cleared up. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Inſtance</hi> 7. But of adoration of Images the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'s not a veſtige in theſe places cited. only <hi>Sozomen</hi> relates that <hi>Julian</hi> pulled down that ſtatue at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> which was ſaid to be Chriſts and ſet up his own in place of it, which was ſtricken from Heaven with Thunder. The Apoſtat having erected his own ſtatue in ſpite againſt Chriſt, and <hi>cap.</hi> 5. when <hi>Julian</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to reedify the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there came fire out of the Earth and conſumed the Builders, and its ſaid the figurs of Croſſes and Stars appeared upon their Cloaths, But of adoration of Images, or of Croſſes, nothing is ſaid. Nay its inſinuated that ſome in thoſe times doubted the truth of the Relation.</p>
                  <p>What eightly is objected to us, from <hi>Hierome, concerning the Hereſies of Jovinian and Vigilantius</hi> was objected before, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 100. and diſcuſſed <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, he ſays, that <hi>with Pelagians we brag of aſſurance of Salvation, apud Hierom. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cont. Pelag.</hi> We do not brag of it, we only ſay through grace it may be attained, yet make it not abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, neither was this ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as a <hi>Pelagian</hi> error. That which St. <hi>Hierom.</hi> refutes in the place cited as <hi>Chamier</hi> ſhews <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. Is the ſinleſs perfection in time, which <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Pelagians</hi> do maintain, yea, not only Ancient Fathers
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:150121:158"/>
but alſo diverſe Popiſh Authors aſſent to us in the matter of aſſurance as St. <hi>Ambroſe, Catharinus, Marcus, Marinarius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, he ſays, <hi>with Jovinians we maintain that they who have received grace in Baptiſm cannot finally fall away apud, August.</hi> But the Hereſy where with St. <hi>Auguſt. in haereſ.</hi> 82. (which I think the <hi>Pamphleter</hi> would have cited) charges <hi>Jovinian</hi> was, that he affirmed, that after Baptiſm men could not ſin. Which none of us affirm, an immunity from final Apoſtacy, and a total immunity from ſin are very different things.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, he ſays, <hi>that with Vigilantius we hold Church men ought to marry, apud Hierom. cont. Vigil.</hi> we ſay no ſuch thing, we only ſay, its lawful for them, but not that they are bound to do it. is there not a difference betwixt <hi>Licere</hi> and <hi>Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, He charges us <hi>with the madneſs of the Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphits, ſaying that the body of Chriſt remaines not in the Euchariſt, if it be keept till the morrow, apud Cyrill ad Colloſyrium.</hi> To this objection of <hi>Breerlys,</hi> it was long ago replyed by Dr. <hi>Marton appeal. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. and <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. that Romaniſts do more reſemble the madneſs of the <hi>Anthropomorphits</hi> by picturing and worſhiping God the Father, in the likeneſs of an old man, and that Proteſtants do not altogether condemn all reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Euchariſt, eſpecially theſe in the Ancient Church, in order to eating and participation, in caſe of abſence from the congregation, thorow ſickneſs and perſecution, and in ſuch reſervations for Sacramental uſe, the conſecrated elements remaine to be the body and blood of Chriſt Symbolically, which is all that <hi>Cyril</hi> intended, for then the Sacramental action is continued. But the Popiſh reſervations for circumgeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proceſſion, and adoration, is a manifeſt innovation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any veſtige of Antiquity. Ancients were wont to give the remainders of the Euchariſt to Children, or School Boys, to be eaten ſays <hi>Niceph. Hist. lib.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. and <hi>Euag. Hiſt. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 35. which was an evidence they looked not on them as a Sacrament, when the Sacramental uſe ceaſed, elſe they would not have given theſe elements to Children, who could not diſcern the Lords body. I only add that theſe reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations uſed by Ancients, are now abrogated in the Romiſh
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:150121:158"/>
Church, as is acknowledged by <hi>Durant. de ritibus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>Thirtenthly, What he objects <hi>of Pelagians concerning Baptiſm, of Eunomians concerning juſtification by Faith alone, and of Arrians concerning Tradition,</hi> was objected <hi>Pag.</hi> 100. and was accordingly diſcuſſed <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Fourtenthly, He ſhuts us all <hi>with three testimonies concerning the infallibility of the Church of Rome.</hi> The <hi>two firſt are from</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> and St. <hi>Iren.</hi> which he oft repeats in his Pamphlet. That <hi>of Iren.</hi> I examined <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Instance</hi> 1. I ſhall now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only take notice of that from <hi>Cyp.</hi> and of the other from <hi>the Council of Chalcedon.</hi> Who would not admire the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this <hi>Pamphleter,</hi> there being no more luculent wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt the infallibility, and ſupremacy of the Pope then St. <hi>Cyp.</hi> and the <hi>Council of Chalcedon?</hi> He repreſents <hi>Cyprians</hi> teſtimony thus <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 55. <hi>to Peters Chaire, and the principal Church, infidelity or falſe Doctrine cannot have acceſs.</hi> To which its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, 1. That if an argument hold from that teſtimony of St. <hi>Cyp.</hi> for papal infallibility, it will likewiſe conclude all the beleeving Romans to be infallible, for their <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſays, <hi>ad Romanos, quorum fides Apoſtolo praedicante landata est, perfidia non poteſt habere acceſſum,</hi> that perfidy can have no acceſs to beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Romans. But ſecondly who warranted the <hi>Pamphleter</hi> to render, <hi>perfidia,</hi> by infidelity or falſe Doctrine. As of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> were only ſpeaking of errors in dogmatical points, where as certainly <hi>Cyprians</hi> words relate alſo, if not princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to queſtions of fact, for he ſubjoyns <hi>aequum &amp; juſtum eſt, ut uniuſcujuſque cauſa illic audiatur, ubi crimen admiſſum eſt.</hi> Its juſt that every mans cauſe be heard in that place, where the crime was committed. ſo that the perfidy of which <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks may be expounded of unfaithfulneſs in judging of crimes, and in examining of ſuch queſtions of Fact. I ſuppoſe Romaniſts will grant Popes may erre, yea <hi>Cyprian</hi> a little after, pleads the Authority of the <hi>African Biſhops</hi> to be no leſs then of the <hi>Italian Biſhops</hi> for judging in ſuch caſes. Thirdly does not <hi>Cyprian Epiſt.</hi> 74. <hi>ad Pompeium</hi> accuſe Pope <hi>Stephanus</hi> not only of error but as mantaining <hi>cauſam haereticorum,</hi> the cauſe of Hereticks againſt the Church. Unleſs therefore St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> be made to contradict himſelf, he cannot here aſſert the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:150121:159"/>
infallibility of the Romiſh Church. Fourthly and laſtly, theſe words <hi>non poteſt habere acceſſum,</hi> cannot have acceſs; muſt not be ſtrained, as excluding a poſſibility of erring, <hi>Non poteſt,</hi> being frequently taken for that, which could not readily or eaſily be, as matters then ſtood. Examples might be brought from Sacred, and prophane Writings, yea and from <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 7. when the man ſaid, I cannot riſe, he meant not impoſſibility of riſing. Is not <hi>Ciceros</hi> phraſe known, <hi>facere non potui, ut nihil tibi literarum darem,</hi> yea and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelf in <hi>Concil. Carthag. ſent.</hi> 1. <hi>nullus Epiſcopus poteſt alium judicare,</hi> yet the preſent uſurpation of the Romiſh Biſhop ſhews their is no impoſſibility in the thing.</p>

                           <hi>The</hi> Pamphleters <hi>Sophiſms for his firſt Propoſition,</hi> viz. <hi>That their is an infallible Propounder, briefly Diſcuſſed.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>FOr the infallibility of a Propounder (which I hope was ſufficiently confuted, <hi>cap.</hi> 2.) he <hi>argues firſt</hi> thus <hi>Pag.</hi> 170. <hi>if their be no infallible propounder, then holy Scripture is propounded by fallible means, and ſo there can be no infallible certainty of Faith.</hi> Anſw. 1. This argument might more forcibly be retorted <hi>ad hominem.</hi> The Scriptures according to this <hi>Pamphleter</hi> are corrupted both in originals and Tranſlations. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there has been no infallible propounder, elſe the Scriptures had been better looked to. But ſecondly, I anſwer, by denying his laſt conſequence, for to the certainty of faith, its enough that we have a certain and infallible rule of Faith, though it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us by fallible Hands. Even as though <hi>Euclids</hi>
                        <pb n="324" facs="tcp:150121:161"/>
elements be conveyed to me by a fallible Hand, yet the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his demonſtrations may breed in me an infallible aſſent to his propoſitions. So the infallible certainty of the Scriptures, as the rule of Faith, may beget an infallible aſſent to Divine truths, though the Hands by which it is conveyed were not infallible. Its true it might have miſcarried in the conveyance, had not the watchful providence of a gracious God preſerved his holy word from periſhing, or being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Yea, the fallibility of the means and Hands by which it is tranſmitted to us, demonſtrates the ſpecial care that God has of his Church, that notwithſtanding the means were ſo fallible in themſelves; yet God preſerved the Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly. Nor can it rationally be denyed that the means of conveyance are of themſelves fallible, ſeeing he made uſe of infidel <hi>Jews</hi> to preſerve the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, as well as of the Chriſtian Church. But I anſwer, Thirdly, the moſt that this objection can conclude, is that the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church whereby ſhe atteſts the Truth of the Scriptures, is certain, which Proteſtants freely admit, and make uſe of it, as one of the motives of Credibility, to prove the truth of the Scriptures. Neither is that to be looked upon as a Tradition ſimply unwritten, the ſame truth being written that <hi>all Scriptures are of Divine inſpiration,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. Neither in any meaſure doth it infringe the ſufficiency of the written word. As when a faithful tabellarius brings a Letter fully containing his Maſters mind, he may atteſt the truth of the Letter, although he remit all the particulars of his Maſters will to be gathered from the Letter it ſelf. And indeed it is much more eaſie to atteſt the truth of a Letter, then faithfully to remember, and give an account of many intricate parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. In this laſt a very honeſt Meſſenger thorow weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might fail. This ſimile is Excellently improven by Dr. <hi>Taylour, Part.</hi> 2.

                     <p>The Pamphleter <hi>argues,</hi> ſecondly <hi>ibid. Faith comes by hearing and therefore as there are infallible hearers and beleevers, ſo alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Teachers,</hi> Anſw. What do Romaniſts and Jeſuits prate of infallible beleevers? Do they not teach that beleevers may totally apoſtatize and become Infidels? A goodly infallibility forſooth! If implicit Romaniſts be infallible beleevers, why
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:150121:161"/>
may not the Turkiſh Muſelmans alſo pretend to infallibility in beleeving the <hi>Alcoran!</hi> But though this Pamphleter do rant here of infallible beleevers, yet were he at <hi>Rome</hi> its probable he would change his tone, for as Dr. <hi>Tiltonſon</hi> on a like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did advertiſe his adverſary, <hi>J. S. we Proteſtants are told that at</hi> Rome <hi>lives an Old Gentleman, who takes it ill, if any be termed infallible heſides himſelf.</hi> In a word therefore I anſwer, if by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible beleevers he mean, that every beleever hath ſuch an aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, as doth exempt him from all Doctrinal errors in Religion, its denyed that beleevers are thus privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, the contrary being evident from the caſe of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who yet were ſmitten with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd errors. Muſt St. <hi>Cyp.</hi> St. <hi>Aug.</hi> &amp;c. Be diſcarded from the number of beleevers, becauſe of the errors where with theſe bleſſed Souls were tainted? At laſt he would bethink himſelf in what category to place erroneous Popes, of whom ſome account was given, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. If therefore by infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible beleevers he only mean thoſe who beleeve infallible truths, upon the Authority of God ſpeaking in the Scriptures, I grant there are infallible beleevers in this ſenſe, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably infallible Teachers, who teach infallible truths from the Scriptures. But hence it doth not follow that there are infallible Teachers in the Romiſh ſenſe, having an immunity from all Doctrinal errors in Religion, whereof the people muſt be aſſured before they give an aſſent of Faith to any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Religion. And the rather ſeeing the Faith of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers is not reſolved on the Authority of their Teachers, but the Faith both of Teachers, and Hearers on the Authority of God ſpeaking in the Scriptures, So that this objection at moſt proves that there are infallible truths, and an infallible rule and ground of Faith, which is freely granted.</p>
                     <p>He <hi>urges thirdly, Pag.</hi> 171. <hi>No other infallible means of beleeving can be aſſigned, for theſe who underſtand not originals.</hi> Anſw. What if I ſhould remit the <hi>Pamphleter</hi> to graple with Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> who maintaines that <hi>if a man beleeve the Chriſtian Doctrine, though upon weak and competent grounds, yet if he live up in his practice to the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, he may be ſaved,</hi> and he brings ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to confirm this aſſertion, in the Preface before his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which I have not as yet heard that his adverſary. <hi>J. S.</hi> hath diſcuſſed. If that notion of the Doctor ſhould prevaile,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:150121:162"/>
the objection of the <hi>Pamphleter</hi> falls to the ground. But when all that is confuted, I have this more to ſay, <hi>viz,</hi> that though propounders be fallible, and Hearers ignorant of Originals, yet the Doctrine it ſelf being atteſted by the miracles of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and Sealed by the death of ſo many Martyrs, and having a ſelf evidencing Light in it ſelf, of which we ſpeake <hi>cap.</hi> 3. and a Divine efficacy upon the heart, there is a ſufficient and infallible ground of beleeving Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Truths.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He argues fourthly,</hi> ibid. <hi>there is no leſs neceſſity that the Church be infallible in propounding, then the evangelists in penning.</hi> O im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent blaſphemy<hi>!</hi> Are Romiſh propounders, Popes and Biſhops, acted by a prophetical Spirit, no leſs then the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Holy Scripture? Why then are not the definitions of their Church added to the Canon of Scripture? Popes muſt ſpeak with tongues, and work miracles before we beleeve them to have prophetical inſpiration. Is not now the Canon of Scripture conſigned? Is there need now (the rule of Faith being compleated) of the ſame aſſiſtance which was at the compiling of that rule?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He argues fifthly,</hi> ibid. <hi>That our Saviour owns the neceſſity of an infallible propounder, granting that the Jews had not ſinned by refuſing to beleeve in him, if by his works and wonders he had not evidenced himſelf to be the Son of God.</hi> A Childiſh argument! Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed affirmed himſelf to be infallible, but it does not follow, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he owned the neceſſity of an infallible propounder in all times. I conſidered before that word of Chriſt to the Jews <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. and ſhew that the moſt which can be concluded from it, is, that there muſt be an objective evidence of the rule of Faith which may be without the propounders infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> be ſays, ibid. <hi>The gift of miracles was given to the Apoſtles and left in the Church to ſhew there infallible aſſiiſtance.</hi> Anſw. there is more here ſaid then proven, that the Apoſtles had the gift of miracles is not denyed, but that this gift was to be left in the Church, ſo as no Divine truth ſhould be beleeved, no Scripture, or ſenſe thereof aſſented to untill the infalliblility of the propounder were proven by new miracles, is more then can be made good. And if it were ſo, none of the Romiſh Miſſionaries ſhould be beleeved, for they work no miracles.

                     <p>And firſt he <hi>remarks Pag.</hi> 174. <hi>that there be three Foundations or grounds of Faith,</hi> viz, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Secondly the Apoſtles and Prophets, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Thirdly the Church,</hi> 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3. 15.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:150121:163"/>
If any of thoſe places make for his purpoſe, it muſt be the third, 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3. 15. but he ſhould have remembred, that its queſtioned, by interpreters whether it be the Church that is there called the Foundation, or if it be not rather that which follows, God manifeſted in the Fleſh, and if it be the Church, whether it be the Catholick Church, or only the particular Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where <hi>Timothy</hi> did officiate, and if this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then ſurely the Foundation cannot be taken in an archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectonick ſenſe for a ſupporter of Faith, but in a Politique ſenſe as a propounder of Faith which makes nothing to his advantage. But of this Text we ſpoke at large, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. Now only I deſire to know how he makes the Apoſtles and Prophets a diſtinct Foundation from the Church? For if he take them perſonally then they were principal members of the Church. If he call them Foundations in regard of their writings then the place holds forth that which Proteſtants affirm, <hi>viz.</hi> The Scripture to be the Foundation or rule of Faith.</p>
                     <p>He endeavours <hi>to confirm this remarke, Pag.</hi> 176 <hi>by alleadging ſome promiſes of an infallible judge, Iſai.</hi> 2. 2. 3. <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11.

Let quibling Miſſionaries know, that broken ſhreads from private Authors have little weight with thoſe that are judicious. Such is that expreſſion of Dr. <hi>Feild,</hi> with which ſo much noiſe is made, <hi>in his Epiſt Dedic.</hi> concerning the Church, which, as <hi>Chillingworth, Part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 86. ſhews, did unadviſedly drop from the Doctor, as its uſual with Authors to Hyperbolize in their prefaces for magnifying the Subject whereof they Write.

                     <p>He argues thirdly, <hi>Pag.</hi> 179. The <hi>true Church is the School of Infallible and Divine truths,</hi> Ergo, <hi>ſhe muſt have infallible Masters,</hi>

                        <hi>and propounders.</hi> Anſw. 1. If by the antecedent he mean, that nothing is at any time taught in the true Church but infallible and Divine truths, its manifeſtly falſe. The Churches of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia</hi> were true Churches, in which groſs errours were Taught; at leaſt, if that were true, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can be no true Church wherein ſo many abſurd errours are Taught. Anſw. 2. the ſequel is alſo falſe, infallible truths may be Taught <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> by Maſters that are fallible. None of our Romiſh Miſſionaries pretend to infallibility, either then, they teach no infallible Truth, or this ſequel muſt be falſe. But, ſaith he, <hi>a Learned writter ſaith, a fallible Church is an holy Cheat.</hi> Anſw. that Author had ſhewed more ſolid Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had he applyed this Character to the Popes infallible Chair, and to the Romiſh infallible viſible judge. If it be asked whether a fallible Church can be ground of infallible Faith? Anſwer, No ſurely, nor will the imagination of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility found a truly Divine and infallible Faith. But the infallible rule of Scripture, can be a ground of infallible Faith, and thereon the Faith of Proteſtants doth reſt.</p>

                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 180. 181. he ſhuts up theſe his ſophiſtical arguments for his ſecond propoſition, with a ſcenical diſcourſe, by which he labours to hold out, that Proteſtants according to their principles could never convince an Heathen of the truth of Chriſtian Religion. <hi>He brings in the</hi> Proteſtant <hi>producing his Bible written,</hi> 1700. <hi>years ago in which there be many contradictions, but no infallible witneſs at preſent to teſtify that this Bible was written by ſuch men, or confirmed by ſuch miracles. Only the</hi> Proteſtant <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadges that if the Infidel would turn</hi> Proteſtant <hi>he would ſee a ſelf evidencing Light in Scripture,</hi> but if prejudice and intereſt had not blinded this <hi>Pamphleters</hi> eyes, he would have found that a Proteſtant could deal with a Heathen upon more ſolid ground, then a Papiſt, for a Papiſt cannot produce a Bible for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſo many Articles thereof having no veſtige there, ſuch as the adoration of Images, invocation of Saints, worſhipping of Croſſes, and Reliques, and the monſtruous figment of Tranſubſtantiation, their unbloody Sacrifice of the Maſs, Doctrine of merits, the Popes univerſal Supremacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the Infidel therefore demands a reaſon upon which theſe things ſhould believed, the Papiſt would reply, they had an infallible judge, and when the Infidel inquired, whom he meant by that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:150121:164"/>
infallible judge, and what evidences he had for his infallibility, he neither can reſolve who he is, it not being determined whether Pope or Council, nor give evidence for his infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but that he muſt be believed, as being infallible, becauſe he ſaith it, which if it do not expoſe Chriſtianity to ludibry, unprejudiced perſons may judge. But Proteſtants have the ſame grounds that ever the Chriſtian Church had, in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Articles of the Chriſtian Religion, and of the holy Scriptures, which doth fully contain them, <hi>viz,</hi> innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable miracles wrought by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, which have been atteſted both by Chriſtians and Infidels, as alſo that theſe Books have been written by Prophets and Apoſtles, hath been acknowledged by Famous perſons, within, and without the Church in all ages, and ſealed by the deaths of ſo many Martyrs. That theſe are the ſame Books, appears by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring our Books with Ancient Copies, by Citations in the Writings of Ancient Fathers, what contrarieties do ſeem to be in Scripture, are but apparent. Let all Religions be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together, there is none whoſe precepts are ſo Holy, no Religion which can ſatisfie a troubled conſcience, ſo as the Chriſtian Religion. Though therein be ſublime myſteries, Yet all are admirably fitted for bringing about the Salvation of ſinners, by theſe and ſuch like Arguments, a Proteſtant could ſo deal with the conſcience of any Infidel, that he could have nothing rationally to reply, and all this without having a recourſe to the infallibility of <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Councils.</hi> In a word, the Divine Original of the Scriptures being once evicted againſt an Infidel from the motives of Credibility, he may then be convinced of the material objects of Faith from the Scriptures.</p>

It may therefore in the firſt place be taken notice of, that great Authors of the Romiſh perſwaſion affirm, <hi>That real and proper Miracles may be wrought by Hereticks to confirm Hereſies,</hi> ſo <hi>Maldonat in cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Math.</hi> Who cites for the ſame opinion of the Fathers, St. <hi>Chryſost.</hi> St. <hi>Hierom, Enthym.</hi> and <hi>Theophilat,</hi> and therefore he concludes the argument from Miracles to be but topical. To the like purpoſe many more Authors of the Romiſh Communion are cited by Dr. <hi>Barron, Apodex. Cathol. tract.</hi> 4. <hi>Punct.</hi> 7. as <hi>Gerſon, Durand, Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Ferus,</hi> to whom <hi>Card. de Lugo, tract. de fid. diſp.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Num.</hi> 15. and 19. addes <hi>Hurtado, Bannez,</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> to whom alſo <hi>Valentia</hi> and <hi>Oviedo</hi> are adjoyned by <hi>Bonaeſpei. tom.</hi> 2. <hi>theol. ſcholaſt tract.</hi> 2. <hi>de fide diſp.</hi> 2. <hi>dub.</hi> 2. If this opinion hold, Miracles cannot be a demonſtrative evidence of the truth, either of Church or Religion. I am not to own <hi>Maldonats</hi> opinion, leſt I ſhould ſeem to derogate from the glorious Miracles of our Saviour, or to charge the God of truth as ſetting his Seal to a lye. But I confidently affirm, that Popiſh Cavils againſt the ſelf evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing Light of Holy Scripture, militate as ſtrongly againſt the ſelf evidence of Miracles, As Jeſuits ask how we know Scriptures to be the word of God. So we may juſtly enquire, how they know theſe things which are attributed to <hi>Francis Dominick, Xavier,</hi> &amp;c. To be proper Miracles? As there are Apocryphal Goſpels under the names of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> ſo there have been falſe Miracles wrought by Satan and his Miniſters.

Behold then how theſe Romiſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors run in a circle, proving the truth of their Church by Miracles, and the truth of Miracles by the teſtimony of their Church. One of the two they muſt acknowledge, either that Scripture hath a ſelf evidencing Light, which will ruin their
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:150121:166"/>
whole intereſt, or that Miracles cary not with them a ſelf evidence, and conſequently are impertinently brought as the firſt and moſt evident note of the true Church. I leave it to the deliberation of our adverſaries which of the two they will chuſe.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, it would be conſidered, that there were indeed glorious miracles wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, nor do we deny that there were Miracles there after in the primitive Church alſo, yet all theſe are <hi>Impertinently alleadged by Romiſh Authors as to this preſent Debate.</hi> For certainly none of the real Miracles done by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, or afterwards in the days of <hi>Irenaeus, Juſtin Martyr, Cyprian, Gregory, Thaumaturg,</hi> were wrought to prove that the Roman Church in theſe laſt days is the only Catholick Church, or that the preſent Syſtem of Romiſh Faith, as defined in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Pope <hi>Pius the Fourth his Creed,</hi> is the only true Chriſtian Faith. Have I not ſhewed Popery as now it ſtands, was not known in theſe days? Theſe Miracles prove the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion in thoſe days, which I have ſhewed to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in Eſſentials from the <hi>Trent</hi> Religion, but to agree with the reformed Religion.</p>
                        <p>How miſerably the Pamphleter comes off as to Miracles in ancient times, may be apparent to any that takes notice of his citations, <hi>pag.</hi> 187. 188. His firſt citation from <hi>Justin Martyr q.</hi> 28. is out of a Book acknowledged to be ſpurious by their own Authors, <hi>Bell. Poſſevin, Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> and <hi>Azorius,</hi> yea, nor was it written within the firſt three Centuries, as is evicted by learned Criticks. And beſides the Author of theſe queſtions mentions not a Miracle wrought for any Popiſh Tenet, far leſs for the complex of all. Only that at the Sepulchres of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, Miracles were done to confirm the truth of the Chriſtian Faith, not the worſhip of Reliques. That of <hi>Irenaeus lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 58. ſpeaks only of Miracles wrought by living Saints, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Infidels. What is that to the Romiſh intereſt? As for the Miracles of <hi>Greg.</hi> of <hi>Neocaeſarea,</hi> commonly called <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturgus,</hi> there is no mention of them for a hundred years after his time, until <hi>Greg. Nyſſen.</hi> If they were all real, is it not ſtrange that <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who uſes to be very punctual in theſe things, has not a touch of them? That <hi>Orat.</hi> of <hi>Nyſſen de vita Greg.</hi> is called by <hi>Scultetus, Somnium Somniorum,</hi> ſurely there be very fabulous
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:150121:166"/>
things therein, as that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>John</hi> came down from Heaven to teach him his Creed, which Dr. <hi>Beard, retract. cap.</hi> 12. compares to the Poetical Fiction of <hi>Apollo,</hi> teaching <hi>Eſculapius</hi> the Rules of Phyſick, and to the Rabinick Fable of the Angel <hi>Sanballets,</hi> being <hi>Adams</hi> School-maſter, and <hi>Nyſſen</hi> himſelf is charged by his Brother <hi>Baſil</hi> as a ſimple and credulous man. But what? Did <hi>Greg. Thaumaturg</hi> work any Miracle to prove the whole Syſtem of the preſent Romiſh Religion to be true? No ſuch thing can be alleadged, only in ſome of his Miracles he is ſaid to have uſed the Sign of the Croſs. What then? Do not Proteſtants particularly <hi>(Hoſpinian lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de templis cap.</hi> 20.) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſign of the Croſs, as uſed by Ancients to teſtifie that they were not aſhamed of a Crucified Saviour to have been lawful, though now it be ſuperſtitiouſly abuſed. Romaniſts now give Religious adoration, yea, that of <hi>Latria,</hi> to Croſſes, But no ancient Author teſtifies that ever <hi>Greg. Thaumaturg</hi> did ſo. What is cited from <hi>S. Cyprian Serm. de lapſis, as relating Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to prove the Corporal preſence of Chriſt, under the Accidents of Bread and Wine,</hi> is a Jeſuitical falſhood; theſe Miracles did prove the Divine Inſtitution of the Sacrament of the Supper, the myſtery of the Incarnation, and the reality of Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, repreſented by the Sacramental Symbols, but no more of the figment of Tranſubſtantiation, then of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Alcoran. Theſe are all the citations he has for the firſt three Ages of Chriſtianity, if there be one Miracle here to prove the preſent <hi>Trent</hi> Religion to the only true Chriſtian Faith, let any who are not willing to be deceived, judge.</p>
                        <p>The like impertinency may be diſcovered in the next three ſucceeding Ages, for the whole Story of the <hi>Invention of the Croſs by</hi> Helena <hi>the Empreſs and Mother of</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>and the Miracle reported by</hi> Ruffin <hi>and</hi> Nicephorus <hi>to be wrought at that time,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be fabulous. Is it probable that <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who wrote four Books of the life of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> would have omitted it. <hi>Dellaeus</hi> is large in confuting it, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de object. Cultus Relig. c.</hi> 1. But ſuppoſe it were true, was that Miracle wrought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm any point of Popery, far leſs all? No verily, the only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, if real, was to ſhow that Jeſus, who was Crucified on that Tree, was the Saviour of the World. <hi>Helena</hi> and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of thoſe days, had not learnt to adore the Croſs. Hence <hi>S. Ambroſe de Obitum Theodoſii,</hi> ſays, <hi>Regem adoravit non lignum,</hi>
                           <pb n="336" facs="tcp:150121:167"/>
ſhe adored Chriſt, but not the Tree. That of <hi>Epiphanius, Hereſ.</hi> 30. looks alſo to be fabulous, and that you think not ſtrange of this, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> credulity is cenſured by <hi>Melchior Canus lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 477. and in many places by <hi>Barronius,</hi> as <hi>Rivet.</hi> hath obſerved in <hi>Crit. Sac. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 28. But make all real that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> there reports, yet the deſign of that Miracle was not to confirm any point of Popery, far leſs all, but only the Chriſtian Religion. Its true <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reports that <hi>Joſephus</hi> who formerly had been a Jew, made uſe of water in working that Miracle, but not any of the four kinds of Popiſh Holy-Water mentioned by <hi>Durand in rationali lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. and though he uſed the ſign of the Croſs, yet he was far from the adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Croſs. That from <hi>Nazianzen Orat.</hi> 11. <hi>of a Virgins Invocating the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>to defeat</hi> Cyprians <hi>Enchantments,</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by <hi>Barronius</hi> himſelf to be a Fable, <hi>ad annum</hi> 250. <hi>Pontius</hi> a Deacon under <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who wrote his life, knew no ſuch thing. <hi>Austin</hi> indeed relates many Miracles <hi>lib.</hi> 22. <hi>de Civ. cap.</hi> 8. But not to prove that this preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Catholick Church, or the preſent Syſtem of Romiſh Faith the true Chriſtian Faith, the moſt is, that at the Sepulchre of <hi>S. Stephen,</hi> and other Saints Miracles were wrought, but not in Veneration of his, or other Reliques. <hi>The Dialogues attributed to</hi> Greg. <hi>are concluded upon,</hi> important Reaſons ſpurious by <hi>Cocus,</hi> yea, by <hi>Melchior Canus, lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. faith is derogated both from the relations in <hi>theſe Dialogues, and</hi> Beeds <hi>Hiſt. Eccleſ. Anglic.</hi> and how little faith is to be given to <hi>Greg. Turonenſis,</hi> may be learned from <hi>Barronius, Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>ad An.</hi> 109. where he calls him a ſimple man, relating many things otherwiſe then they were, ſo that in theſe other three Centuries I can ſee nothing ſave only that Miracles were wrought at the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Martyrs, and perhaps divers of theſe relations alſo were fabulous, but what is this to the Body of Popiſh Errors and Superſtitions.</p>
                        <p>No better are the Pamphleters inſinuations, <hi>pag.</hi> 192. of the Miracles wrought by our <hi>Scottiſh Saints, Saint Mungo, and Saint Fiaker,</hi> adding, <hi>That a Miracle makes the Arms of one of our Cities,</hi> I ſuppoſe he means <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> which hath in her Coat of Armes a Fiſh with a Ring in its Mouth, but of St. <hi>Mungoes</hi> Miracles, hear Biſhop <hi>Spotſwood, Hiſt. pag.</hi> 11. of which ye may judge of the reſt. <hi>Many lying Miracles</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have been aſcribed to him,</hi>
                           <pb n="337" facs="tcp:150121:167"/>
                           <hi>but certainly he was a man of rare Piety, and worthy to have been made a Subject of Truth to Poſterity, not of Fables and Fictions, as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends of Monks have made him.</hi> As for that ſuppoſed Miracle to which the Arms of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> ſeem to allude, it was not wrought to confirm any point of Religion, far leſs of Popery, but to vindicate the Chaſtity of a Lady who was unjuſtly jealouſed by her Husband, as Biſhop <hi>Spotſwood</hi> gives an account, <hi>pag.</hi> 112. But if Popiſh Miſſionaries muſter up Legends to a credulous people, they ſtand not whether they be to purpoſe or not: The real ancient Miracles then are altogether impertinently alledged by the Pamphleter.</p>
                        <p>I add thirdly, <hi>that the Legendary Paltry of Romiſh Miracles of lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, is generally ſpurious:</hi> They might be reduced to theſe Heads; <hi>viz.</hi> Either 1. Meer Forgeries; or 2. Cunning Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems of ſubtil perſons; or 3. Magical Impoſtures; or 4. They are manifeſtly ludibrious; who pleaſe may find this largely proved by <hi>Gerard, loc. de Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 284. How oft have the Cheats of Romaniſts, as to theſe things, been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered?

Nay of <hi>Formoſus</hi> he ſaith, he came to the Papacy, <hi>largitione potius quam virtute,</hi> rather by Simony than Vertue, yea and by Perjury alſo, if he wrought Miracles: I am ſure Pope <hi>Stephanus</hi> the Sixth had little regard to them, when he raiſed his Corps, and degraded him after his death, and cut off the Fingers he uſed in Ordinations; and <hi>Sergius</hi> the Third proceeds yet further, and not only raiſes his Corps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but throws it into <hi>Tiber.</hi> I confeſs <hi>Platina in vita Serg.</hi> 3. ſaith, there was a rumour, that the Fiſhers finding his Body, brought it to <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, and buried it, which as they were doing, the Images in <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church did obeyſance to the dead Body of <hi>Formoſus;</hi> but <hi>Platina</hi> himſelf queſtions the truth of it.

The Reader may judge of the reſt of his Miracles, by that Romance of his hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Devil by the Noſe with a pair of Fiery Pincers; but the <hi>Legerdemain</hi> trick which he was ſaid to uſe againſt the poor Secular Prieſts at <hi>Calne</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> was moſt pernicious, they being at a great Debate with the Monks whom <hi>Dunſtan</hi> owned againſt the Seculars, it's reported he had ſo ordered, that the Timber ſhould fall on the Seculars, and deſtroy them, to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the Debate. If theſe be the Romiſh Miracles, the good Lord preſerve us from them: The ſtory of that Magician Saint is largely related by <hi>Fuller.</hi> It ſeems they muſt be ſcarce of Real Miracles, when among the Workers of them they reckon <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. ſeditious <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> whom Cardinal <hi>Benno</hi> holds for a Magician; did it not ſavour more of Magick, than of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Miracles, to ſhake fire out of his Gown-ſleeves.

Among all theſe Legends of Fictitious Miracles, ſhall <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> have no ſhare? It had not been for the Honour of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that the Pamphleter had forgotten <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> and <hi>Xavier, Alphonſus de Vargas de ſtratagem. Jeſuit. c.</hi> 2, 3. gives them this teſtimony, that never a Generation among Mortals was more impudent in obtruding impoſterous lyes on the world than Jeſuits, which the Author confirms by remarkable inſtances; nay, ſo ingenious are they in ſuch devices, they could hold the world in hand with a miraculous impreſs of <hi>Garnet</hi>'s Image upon a Straw at his execution. But not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs from <hi>Loyola</hi> and <hi>Xavier,</hi> I cannot deny that <hi>Maffeius</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badeneira</hi> Jeſuits, report ſtrange Miracles of <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> as <hi>that he would hang in the Air with a wondrous ſplendour, that he did with corporal eyes behold Chriſt in the Sacrament, yea, and the Trinity; that Chriſt and the</hi> Virgin Mary <hi>often appeared to him; that he would beat the Devil with a Rod, and conjure him with a Letter; that he would behold the Souls of dying Jeſuits aſcending to Heaven, that he hath helped Women in hard labour, and thoſe that have been ſmitten with the Peſtilence, and other grievous diſeaſes;</hi> as if <hi>Ignatius</hi> were to make a Monopoly of the imployment of other petty Saints, ſuch as Saint <hi>Roch,</hi> who did Patronize them who had the Plague; Saint <hi>Coſmas</hi> and <hi>Damian,</hi> the Patron of Phyſitians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea and of Saint <hi>Lucina</hi> alſo, who among Romaniſts ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Heatheniſh <hi>Juno,</hi> for helping Women in Labour. Perhaps alſo he may intrude upon Saint <hi>Apollinaris</hi> work for curing the <hi>French Pox.</hi> But among the many Cures he is ſaid to have wrought, I never heard that he could cure himſelf of his lameneſs; however, it cannot be denied, but great things are aſcribed to him; but the miſery is, theſe Miracles, as <hi>Hoſpin.</hi> obſerves, <hi>Hiſt.

If God had wrought ſo many Miracles, as he relates, to confirm Image-worſhip, is it like that he would have wrought none in the firſt three Ages of Chriſtianity? or if then he did work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to prove Image-worſhip, would not the Fathers have had as much faithfulneſs and zeal as <hi>Lipſius,</hi> to have tranſmitted them to Poſterity? I deny not to <hi>Lipſius</hi> his skill in Grammar, but of his Piety, or skill in Divinity, I have not read much. I muſt remember this Pamphleter to give a more perfect account in the next, of his <hi>Polonian Miracle; by which,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>one was raiſed to life after he had been ſeven years dead, and brought before the King to witneſs that he had ſold ſuch a piece of Land to the Church.</hi> But he hath forgotten to tell us the Hiſtorian who did relate it, or by whom the Miracle was wrought, or who the Man was that was raiſed. Did he not conſider there might be a doubt raiſed, whether that Specter were a <hi>Meridianus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Daemon,</hi> a Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide Devil, in humane ſhape? He will adviſe in his next to clear this. If the man were raiſed to verifie a Vendition of Land, what is that to the preſent Controverſie of Religion? only he atteſted, that the Land was ſold to the Church. All that I can conclude from this is, that the pretended Miracles of Monks and Fryars are done upon a lucrative account. I look on this Romance like the fictitious Miracles of the <hi>Polonian Saint Hia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

I cannot but in the ſeventh place remember Romaniſts, <hi>that they take for granted, which Learned Protestants will not yield; that there have been no Miracles wrought in the Proteſtant Churches.</hi> If <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> (ſaith <hi>Whittaker, controv.</hi> 2. <hi>q.</hi> 5. <hi>de notis Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 12.) may be credited, who was a faithful and modeſt man, <hi>Luther</hi> was honoured of God to work Miracles.

Nor can it but ſeem ſtrange to hear Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts talking ſo much of their Miracles, and yet can work none among us Proteſtants, whom they hold for Hereticks and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels; if they can work Miracles, why have they not ſo much compaſſion to our Souls, as to work them before intelligent Proteſtants? One Miracle wrought before our eyes would have more impreſſion, than a thouſand Fabulous Legends of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, pretended to be wrought in the <hi>Indies,</hi> among the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes,</hi> or in <hi>

I confeſs in the Ancient Roman Church there were miracles wrought to confirm the truth of her Faith, but not her Catholiciſm, as if ſhe only had been the Chriſtian Church; for ſhe was but a particular Church at beſt, the preſent Romiſh Church hath foully Apoſtatized from the Faith of the Ancient Church, ſearch your Records and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends to find one true Miracle to confirm the Faith and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciſm of the preſent Romiſh Church; this you will find im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, for her Faith is unſound, and Catholiciſm, in the ſenſe ſpoken of, ſhe never had.</p>

                        <p>But from this Head of Miracles, I demonſtrate the truth of the Proteſtant Religion thus:
<q>
                              <hi>That Religion which is confirmed by the moſt real, indubitate, and glorious Miracles which ever the world had, is ſurely the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; But the Religion of Proteſtants is confirmed by the moſt real, indubitate, and glorious Miracles which ever the world had;</hi> Ergo, <hi>The Religion of Proteſtants is the true Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Aſſumption, concerning which only the doubt can be, is proved thus; The Apoſtolick Religion is confirmed by the moſt glorious Miracles that ever the world ſaw; but the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Proteſtants is the Apoſtolick Religion; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Proteſtants is confirmed by the moſt real, indubitate Miracles, that ever the world ſaw. The major none can deny but an Infidel; for evidencing the minor, let the Religion of Proteſtants be examined by the Scriptures, which contain the Apoſtolick Religion, and if one Article be found in our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion diſſonant there-from, we ſhall inſtantly diſown it. The Reader here may obſerve the difference betwixt the Romiſh procedure, and ours; we confirm our Religion by the indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Miracles, which prove Chriſtianity it ſelf; they by ſome fabulous, at beſt uncertain Legendary ſtories, the truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is queſtioned by their own Authors, and the falſhood of many detected to the world. If it be ſaid, <hi>that any Heretick may argue as we do, to confirm their Hereſie,</hi> I ſhall not now ſtand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, how Hereticks have argued for their Hereſie from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Miracles, as do Romaniſts to day: Only to ſhew the diſparity betwixt us and Hereticks, I undertake againſt all the Enemies of Truth in the world, to prove the real conformity of the Reformed Religion with the Apoſtolick revealed in Scripture, and the diſconformity of all Hereſies whatſoever. It's a real conformity with Apoſtolick Doctrine, not pretended only, which proves it to be confirmed by Apoſtolick Miracles.</p>

                        <p>THe <hi>ſecond Note</hi> whereby this Pamphleter would prove <hi>the Catholiciſm of their Romiſh Church, is, that by her all Chriſtian Nations have been converted to the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this, he following <hi>Bell. Breerly,</hi> and the Drove, hints at a multitude of ſtories, which upon examination will be found of no ſignificancy to the point in hand.</p>
                        <p>For firſt, it's a moſt notorious falſhood, <hi>that all Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been converted by the Romiſh Church;</hi> was the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> converted by her, or the Church of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> or of <hi>Antioch,</hi> or the Greek Churches in general? As <hi>Eve</hi> was the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Living, ſo not the <hi>Roman;</hi> but the Church of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> may be termed the Mother of all Churches. And ſo ſhe is deſigned by the ſecond General Council at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as witneſſes <hi>Theod. Hiſt. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. The Biſhop of <hi>Bitontum,</hi> in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> acknowledged <hi>Greece</hi> to be the Mother of all that the Latin Church had. Doth not <hi>Theod. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Hiſt. cap.</hi> 22. report that the <hi>Indians</hi> were converted by <hi>Lay-men, Ede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> and <hi>Frumentius;</hi> and that for carrying on the work, <hi>Frumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> received Ordination from <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> then Patriarch of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> and not from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi> The Pamphleter but plays the Cheat, when he alledges, that our Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> owes her firſt Converſion to Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> his Legats and Envoys. The Reader may ſee the falſhood of this proved by Biſhop <hi>Spotſwood, Hiſt. pag.</hi> 21. <hi>edit.</hi> 3. Theſe Preachers ſent hither by <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictor,</hi> were ſent upon the entreaty of King <hi>Donald</hi> the Firſt, which the King would not have ſought, had he not been Chriſtian before. If our Converſion had been wrought by Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> how came it that our Church was not faſhioned to the Roman in outward rites, eſpecially in the obſervance of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> whereof <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictor</hi> was but prepoſterouſly zealous? Much more probable looks the conjecture of Biſhop <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> that ſome of <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, under the perſecution of <hi>Domitian,</hi> have had their refuge hither, and were inſtruments of planting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity among us; and the rather, becauſe this Church was
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:150121:174"/>
very tenacious of the Oriental Cuſtoms, alledging for it the Authority of <hi>John.</hi> However, <hi>Scotland</hi> was very anciently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with the Goſpel; hence is that of <hi>Tertul. adverſus Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeos cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Britannorum Romanis inacceſſa loca, Chriſto vero ſubdita;</hi> and their conformity in rites with the Greek Church, and not with the Latin, ſhew their Original was not from <hi>Rome.</hi> It is a manifeſt falſhood then, that the Roman Church is the Mother of all, or of our Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But ſecondly, this Pamphleter deceitfully <hi>confounds and joyns together the endeavours of the Ancient Romiſh Church for convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Nations, with the practiſes of the preſent Romiſh Church for Proſeliting Countries to the Popiſh perſwaſion.</hi> We acknowledge the Roman Church was inſtrumental in converting many Nations to Jeſus Chriſt; but it was not to the preſent Romiſh Faith, that not being then hatched, but to the Chriſtian Faith. The like alſo was done by other Churches, particularly by the Greek Church. Hence <hi>Ephraim Pagit</hi> in his <hi>Chriſtianography, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 21. renders this as one reaſon of the large Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the converſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations to the Chriſtian Faith by his Suffragans. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though it were true that <hi>Scotland</hi> did owe her converſion to <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictor,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> (both which are falſe; yea, the Goſpel was planted in <hi>Britain</hi> ſome years before it came to <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, if <hi>Baronius</hi> ſtory concerning <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea, ad annum</hi> 35. or <hi>Gildas</hi> teſtimony, that <hi>Britain</hi> received the Goſpel in the end of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi>'s Reign, deſerve credit) this makes nothing for the truth of the preſent Romiſh Faith, or Catholiciſm of the preſent Romiſh Church, for the Ancient Romiſh Church declined from the Faith of the preſent Popiſh Church, as well as we.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Particular Churches, though not altogether ſound in the Faith, but ſtained with ſome errours in the integrals of Religion, <hi>may be inſtrumental in converting Nations:</hi> As a Leprous man may beget Children, he is a man, though not a found man. In this caſe it's by vertue of the ſound Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity retained in theſe Churches, that they beget Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and not of their errors; nay, their errors do oft-times deface the work, for with the truths of the Goſpel they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their errours. Such were theſe converſions of Nations, wherein the Roman Church had a hand in the intermedial A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:150121:174"/>
as thoſe of <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Boniface:</hi> For ſure it is, that in <hi>Germany</hi> the Goſpel had been preached long before the time of that <hi>Boniface,</hi> ſent thither by <hi>Creg.</hi> 2. in the eigth Century, as <hi>Baronius ad annum</hi> 690. doth acknowledge; and <hi>Boxbornias in Hiſt. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſali, pag.</hi> 198. doth prove from <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that the ſeeds of the Chriſtian Religion were ſown in <hi>Germany</hi> in the ſecond Century; and therefore <hi>pag.</hi> 101. he exhibits An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Verſions of the Apoſtolick Creed, both in the <hi>Aleman</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Languages. I ſhall not ſay, but by <hi>Boniface</hi> the Goſpel hath been propagated in <hi>Germany,</hi> yet ſurely with many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, wherewith at that time the Roman Church was tainted; and therefore he was zealouſly oppoſed by holy men, particularly by <hi>Adelbertus, Clemens, Sampſon, Sydonius, Virgilius,</hi> as is ſhewed by the Author of <hi>Catal. teſt. verit. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 755. and <hi>Hottinger Saec.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 527. The like was the caſe of <hi>Auſtin</hi> his Converſion of <hi>England;</hi> the Goſpel was in <hi>England</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came over, and more pure than he preached it, yet it cannot be denied but he was inſtrumental to convert many, who till that time had retained their Heatheniſm; but with the Goſpel he did alſo introduce many Superſtitions, which were zealouſly oppoſed by <hi>Britiſh</hi> Chriſtians, for a long time. The converting of Souls to Chriſt therefore proves not a Church to be ſound, far leſs the Catholick Church. Did not the Jewiſh Church beget Sons and Daughters to God, when ſhe was defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Superſtition and Idolatry? yea, have not private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons been inſtrumental in converting Souls to God, as ſome Exiled Slaves converted the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Africk.</hi> See <hi>Baron. ad an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> 456. <hi>N.</hi> 4.</p>
                        <p>But fourthly, It's more evident than can be denied, <hi>that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and Infidels have prevailed with Nations to be of their perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Doth not Hereſie ſpread as a Gangrene? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Did not Phariſees compaſs Sea and Land to make Proſelites?</hi> Mat. 23. 15. <hi>though they made them the Children of the Devil more than themſelves?</hi> How many Nations have been leavened by <hi>Mahumetaniſm?</hi> Neither was that done only by force of Arms, as <hi>Bell.</hi> alledges, but alſo by corrupting the judgments of men; <hi>Mahumetans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving their <hi>Alcoran</hi> as firmly, as Papiſts do their <hi>Tridentine</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. Is it not told that Antichriſt ſhould come with ſtrong deluſion, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11. yea, and with ſuch ſucceſs, that the World ſhould wonder after the Beaſt? <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 3. How many
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:150121:175"/>
Nations were corrupted by Arrianiſm? Do we not find the Leaven of Socinianiſm, Quakeriſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> prevailing with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? So that the Argument from bringing multitudes to the ſame perſwaſion is very fallacious, unleſs the Faith to which perſons are brought be ſound. And if it muſt be ſuppoſed that the Faith be ſound, before an Argument be forcible from that ground, there muſt be another Evidence for the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Faith, than this Pamphleter hath brought.

                        <p>Fifthly, It's a falſhood, <hi>that no Nations have been converted by</hi>

                           <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> How many Nations have imbraced the Truth, and forſaken the Idolatry of Popery, as <hi>Scotland, England, Ireland,</hi> the <hi>

But beſides <hi>Gerard de Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. §. 258. teſtifies, that by Proteſtants many thouſands have been converted from Heatheniſm, in <hi>Iſland, Greenland, Lapland, Livonia, &amp;c.</hi> Not to mention the many <hi>Indians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in <hi>New-England,</hi> and other parts of <hi>America:</hi> But though it were granted that Heathen Nations had not been converted by them, this would only charge Proteſtants of a ſinful negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but not prove their Religion to be falſe. Methinks this clamour of Romaniſts againſt our Churches for not beſtirring themſelves more zealouſly for the Converſion of Infidel Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhould awake Proteſtant Princes, and Churches ſeriouſly to conſider, what may be done for the Converſion of Infidels, both for the advantage of the Goſpel, and to ſtop the mouths of our cavilling Adverſaries.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, Any Converſions made by <hi>Romanists, have been very unlike the Primitive Converſions made by the Apoſtles;</hi> theſe have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally been by force, even theſe made in the intermedial Ages, wanted not force; that of <hi>Boniface</hi> among the <hi>Thuringians,</hi> was done <hi>terrore armorum,</hi> as <hi>Gerard</hi> obſerves <hi>ex Chronico Iſenacenſi, Cent.</hi> 8. <hi>Eccleſ. Hiſt. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Charles the Great</hi> brought the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to imbrace the Chriſtian Faith by bloody Wars. But as for the late Romiſh Converſions, which only can be attributed to the preſent Romiſh Church, how bloody have many of them been? Who can read what their own <hi>Bartholomaeus de la Caſa</hi> hath written of the proceeding of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> without horrour? Did not a Great Perſon, when a dying, hearing that <hi>Catholick Spaniards</hi> went to Heaven, profeſs he would never go there, if <hi>Spaniards</hi> went thither, judging it could be no good place where ſuch bloody men went. Yea <hi>Granado,</hi> as cited by <hi>Gerard, loc. de Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. §. 188. confeſſes, <hi>Ea crudelitatis immanitate Hiſpanos erga illos uſos, ut Sanctiſſimum Chriſtiani nomen, non Pietatis &amp; Religionis, ſed crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatis &amp; immanitatis nomen habitum ſit;</hi> that is, through their
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:150121:176"/>
Barbarity the holy name of Chriſtians became an Epithete of cruelty. As for the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> it's ſuppoſed there were ſome remainders of the Chriſtian Faith among them left by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of theſe people in ancient times, and the truth of Popiſh relations concerning converſions there, are juſtly to be queſtioned, finding how unfaithful they are in Relations nearer home, whereof I gave a hint <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. And beſides, their deſign is to convert them rather to the Pope, and Papal Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, than to Jeſus Chriſt: But if any Real Converſion be wrought by them, it's wholly to be attributed to the common Principles of Chriſtianity, yet retained among Papiſts, but not to any of their Popiſh errours.</p>
                        <p>Let the Pamphleter notice theſe particulars, and then frame an Argument if he can, without Rhetorical declamations, to prove their Church to be the true Catholick and Infallible Church.</p>
                        <p>But I invert alſo this his ſecond Note, and from it prove the truth of the Proteſtant Religion, thus; That Religion by which alone Nations have been converted to the true Chriſtian Faith, is the only true Religion; but by the Religion which Proteſtants hold, Nations have only been converted; <hi>Ergo.</hi> I prove the Aſſumption by the Apoſtolick Religion, Nations have only been converted to the true Faith, but the Religion of Proteſtants is the Apoſtolick Religion, and we own none elſe. Let theirs and ours be compared if they be not the ſame, <hi>Ergo,</hi> by the Religion of Proteſtants Nations have only been converted. If any again ſay, <hi>that a Quaker, or other Heretick, may make the ſame Argument,</hi> it hath been anſwered already. Let matters be brought to tryal by Scriptures, which contain the Apoſtolick Religion, and it ſhall be found, our Religion, and not theirs, is the true Apoſtolick Religion: And we have this ſtrong preſumption for us againſt both Papiſts and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, neither of them dare refer the Controverſie to the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Scripture, the one running to an infallible viſible Judge, the other to an infallible Light within. But we remit all to the deciſion of Scriptures, which Chriſtians of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions acknowledge to be of Divine Inſpiration, yet it's not by preſumptions we would deal, but by a particular examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Controverſies; let their Cauſe only prevail, who have real conformity with Scriptures.</p>

                        <p>Leaving this charge of Perſonal Ungodlineſs, that I may ſtrike at the Root of the Cauſe, I argue thus; That Religion, whoſe Principles have a manifeſt tendency to Ungodlineſs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the true Chriſtian Religion; but the Principles of the Popiſh Religion, and more eſpecially as maintained by Jeſuits, have a manifeſt tendency to unholineſs; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and more eſpecially as maintained by Jeſuits, cannot be the true Chriſtian Religion. The major is evident; the true Chriſtian Religion being <hi>a Doctrine according to Godlineſs, Tit.</hi> 1. 1. The Aſſumption might be confirmed by many inſtances; <hi>Gerard</hi> the <hi>Lutheran, Loc. de Eccleſ. Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. draws a large Catalogue of impious Popiſh Tenets, contrary to the Articles of the Apoſtolick Creed, and to the Commands of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue: I will only hint at a few, which yet I hope ſhall ſuffice to prove the thing.</p>
                        <p>Inſtance 1. The Popiſh Religion teaches <hi>manifold groſs Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;</hi> as 1. To give the <hi>Supreme worſhip due to God, to that, which after Conſecration, is eaten in the Euchariſt;</hi> as is defined in the Council of <hi>Trent, Seſſ.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. But that which after Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration is eaten is proper real Bread, as I proved <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. and the ſenſes of all men declare, nor can they avoid the guilt of Idolatry, by ſaying they adore the Euchariſtick Bread, as ſuppoſing it to be God; elſe the Heathens worſhipping the Sun, or Devil, and ſuppoſing them to be God, ſhould be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from Idolatry alſo. Secondly, Popery teaches <hi>to give the ſame Supreme worſhip of Latry to the Croſs.</hi> This is not only the common Opinion of Romiſh Doctors, as teſtifies <hi>Azorius, Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Inſtit. Moral. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. but if we may believe <hi>Aquinas, Part.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 25. <hi>art.</hi> 4. it's the Doctrine of the Romiſh Church; and that it is ſo, Learned <hi>Dallaeus lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de object. cult. Religioſ. cap.</hi> 3. confirms by many Evidences from the Roman Pontifical, Miſſals, and Breviaries. If he be not an Idolater, who gives the Supreme worſhip of <hi>Latria</hi> to a piece of Wood, or Stone, or Silver in ſhape of a Croſs, I pray who is? Thirdly, Popery teaches that <hi>Religious worſhip is to be given to Images;</hi> yea, if we may credit <hi>Azorins loc. cit.</hi> it's the common Sentiment of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:150121:179"/>
Doctors, that the ſame Religious worſhip is to be given to Images, and to the Prototipe, and conſequently the Images of Chriſt, and of the Trinity, are to be adored with <hi>Latria.</hi> If any will ſay, that Images are not properly to be adored, but only the Prototipe before the Image, <hi>Bell.</hi> ſpares not <hi>lib. de I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mag. cap.</hi> 21. to aſſert, that they are Anathematized by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Council of <hi>Nice, Act.</hi> 7. The impiety of this Doctrine is ſuch, that <hi>Bell. lib. cit. cap.</hi> 22. adviſes, that it be ſparingly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>in concionibus ad populum:</hi> Fourthly, Popery teaches <hi>that Saints and Angels are to be Religiouſly adored and invocated,</hi> as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the Council of <hi>Trent Seſſ.</hi> 25. <hi>Decret. de Invocat. &amp;c.</hi> to Saints they kneel, they erect Temples, and Altars, they pray, they ſwear by them, offer Incenſe to them, they celebrate Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to their honour, they aſcribe to them, eſpecially to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> Titles full of Blaſphemy, whereof <hi>Stembergius in Idea Papiſmi, Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. hath collected an Epitome, ſuch as, <hi>The Ocean of the Deity, the Complement of the Trinity, the Savioureſs of the World, the Queen of Heaven, the Author of Grace, to whom from God it is lawful to appeal, &amp;c.</hi> Though to other Saints ſuch high Titles be not aſcribed, yet to them alſo they give Religious Worſhip proper to God alone. Hence Bell, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Cult. Sanct. cap.</hi> 9. renders this reaſon why they make Vows to Saints, becauſe they are <hi>Dii per participationem,</hi> Gods by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation. Is not their Canonization of Saints called <hi>Apotheoſis,</hi> a kind of Deification? Fifthly, Popery alſo teaches, that <hi>it's lawful to give Religious Adoration to the Relicks of Saints;</hi> to their Bones, their Fleſh, their Blood, their Teeth, their Hair, their Nails, their Cloaths, their Shoes, their Combs, their Whips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in the laſt cited Decree, and <hi>Vaſq.</hi> in 3. <hi>Part. q.</hi> 25. <hi>diſp.</hi> 112.

then the Cardinals kneeling, and kiſſing his hands and his feet, do Religiouſly adore him; and this by the <hi>Italians</hi> is by way of Eminence, ſays mine Author, called <hi>L'adoratione.</hi> To ſhut up this firſt inſtance, either Idolatry is no part of ungodlineſs, or the Popiſh Religion hath a manifeſt tendency to ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>

Fifthly, by their <hi>Implicit Faith,</hi> and by prohibiting the multitude to read the Scriptures, they do nouriſh Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is both a ſin it ſelf, and the cauſe of more ſin. And ſixthly, not to add more, have not the Popiſh Caſuiſts, eſpecially Jeſuits, by their <hi>Doctrine of Probables, and regulating of their intentions,</hi> taught a way how to commit Villanies without ſin, at leaſt a Mortal ſin; if this be not to open a Gap to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, thoſe who have any ſenſe of the true fear of God may judge.</p>
                        <p>Inſtance 4. Popery contradicts the <hi>Great Deſign of the Goſpel,</hi> which is to ſet forth Jeſus Chriſt as our compleat Saviour. For firſt, it teaches that <hi>Chriſt has not ſatisfied for all our ſins,</hi> but that
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:150121:181"/>
we our ſelves muſt ſatisfie, either here, or in Purgatory, not only for the puniſhment due to theſe ſins which they call Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, but alſo for the temporal puniſhment due to Mortal ſins; yea <hi>Ruardus Tapperus,</hi> as <hi>Bell.</hi> teſtifies <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de paenit. cap.</hi> 1. adds, <hi>that we may make ſatisfaction to God for the ſin it ſelf, and the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhment due thereto.</hi> Secondly, Popery teaches, if we may believe the <hi>Rhemiſts Annot. in</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>that good works are truly and properly meritorious, and fully worthy of eternal life; and that thereupon Heaven is the due, and juſt ſtipend, Crown, or recompence, which God by his Juſtice oweth to the perſons ſo working;</hi> inſomuch that they ſpare not to ſay, <hi>Annot. in Heb.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>that God would be unjuſt if he rendred not Heaven for the ſame.</hi> To the like purpoſe they ſpeak <hi>Annot. in</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. Are not theſe impious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines highly injurious to our Bleſſed Redeemer? For if he hath ſatisfied fully for all our ſins, and merited Heaven fully for us, there is no place left for our Merits, or ſatisfaction. And to ſet up humane merits and ſatisfactions, is to accuſe the ſatisfaction and Merits of Chriſt of imperfection. It's but a ridiculous and impious evaſion of Papiſts, that they derogate nothing from Chriſt by their ſatisfactions and merits, becauſe Chriſt purchaſed to them Grace to ſatisfie, and Merit. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that this is a meer figment, and precarious Aſſertion, without a ſhadow of ground from Scripture, it carries a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy in its own boſom; for if humane ſatisfactions flow from Grace purchaſed by Chriſt, they are not proper ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeeing theſe muſt be <hi>ex propriis, &amp; indebitis,</hi> of that which is our own, and not due to him to whom the ſatisfaction is made; beſides ſatisfactions muſt be <hi>ad aequalitatem,</hi> equal to to the injury done: Now can any thing done by us be equal to the offence of the infinite Majeſty of God?

                        <p>As 1. That Jeſuits hold <hi>that it's ſufficient that men love God once before they die; that we are not ſo much commanded to love God, as not to hate him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, that a man may be ſaved without ever loving God:</hi> That this is taught by Jeſuits, eſpecially by <hi>Sirmondus,</hi> is ſhewed <hi>Provinc.

                        <p>Fourthly, Jeſuits <hi>excuſe and extenuate the ſins of ſwearing, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheming,</hi> as is ſhewed copiouſly in the Jeſuits Morals, <hi>pag.</hi> 291.

                        </p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Jeſuits have ſo little regard to the Spiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, <hi>that they affirm that it's enough that a man be bodily preſent at Religious Service, though he be abſent as to his mind, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding he behave himſelf with external reverence,</hi> This <hi>Montalt Epiſt.

Though in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture this charge be laid upon Fathers, that Daughters be given in Marriage by them, though many examples of Saints do ſhew this manifeſtly, yet I anſwer (ſaith he) with <hi>Sanchez, that theſe, and ſuch like, prove well, that it's very commendable for them to demand their Fathers advice, but not that they in not doing ſo, fall into the horrible diſorder of mortal ſin.</hi> Thus Jeſuits inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently elude Scriptures, and Fathers, to countenance diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and impudence in children, and to favour Rapes and Clandeſt me Marriages.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, <hi>Jeſuits, contrary to the ſixth Command, authorize moſt bloody murthers;</hi> as that a man who could eſcape by flying, may kill another, who intends to aſſault him for his life.

Of the theftuous practiſes of Jeſuits, according to theſe their principles, a large account is given in a Tractate, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Moral practiſe of Jeſuits:</hi> Nay, they teach how to make Simoniacal tranſactions without ſin, by ordering of the intentions, as is ſhewed in <hi>Pyrotechnica Loyolana, pag.</hi> 44.</p>
                        <p>I only add tenthly, that Jeſuits teach <hi>groſs violations of the ninth Command,</hi> not only by their equivocations, and mental reſervations, at which I hinted before, but alſo by ſaying, that it is allowable to defame an Adverſary, by charging him with crimes whereof he is not guilty, as is ſhewed by <hi>Montalt Epiſt.</hi> 15. Theſe Principles of Lying being inſtilled by Jeſuits into the Empereſſes Ladies, the whole Court was put into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion

by falſe reports, until <hi>Quivoga</hi> the Capucin convinced the Empreſs of theſe pernicious lying Principles of Jeſuits. Time would fail me in reckoning forth the impious Doctrines of Jeſuits; theſe few hints, I hope, may ſuffice to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that the Doctrines of Popery, and more eſpecially as maintained by Jeſuits, have a Native tendency to impiety.

times; yet we ſhould not ſo much blame them who betake themſelves to Monaſtick retirements, if they gave themſelves to the ſerious ſtudy of Mortification, and to the true exerciſe of Religious Duties preſcribed in the holy Scriptures. But the devotion of Romiſh Monks is for moſt part meer Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, conſiſting in the obſervation of ſome Rules invented by ſuperſtitious perſons, as <hi>Francis, Dominick, &amp;c.</hi> What im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety is acted under a pretence of Monaſtick auſterity, I hinted before. Now let any conſider what great Mortification it is, under a pretence of Poverty, to go into ſtately Palaces endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rich Revenues? under a pretence of Faſting, to feed on ſuch chear, as a Senſual Epicure would prefer before ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Feaſts? under a pretence of Chaſtity, to Vow againſt Marriage, which is Gods Ordinance, but not againſt other fleſhly impurities? Hence <hi>Bell.</hi> gives this reaſon why it's leſs ſin for a Prieſt to Fornicate than Marry, becauſe by Marrying he violates the Vow of Continency, implying they vow not againſt Concubines. Laſtly, many who retire to Monaſteries, do it either on a <hi>tedium</hi> of worldly buſineſs, or diſcontent, or ſuperſtitiouſly, to expiate ſome atrocious crime, <hi>deſperatio fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Monachum.</hi>

                        <p>But thirdly, ſays he, <hi>they have Saints, as</hi> Gregori<hi>'s, and</hi> Leo<hi>'s, and</hi> Caeleſtin<hi>'s. &amp;c.</hi> But who gave their Pope power of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Saints? Is not this an Innovation unknown to Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? How can the Pope infallibly know the Sanctity of others, when he cannot be ſure of his own? Nay, have not many of them lived like incarnate Devils? Have they not Canonized ſome for Money? others to promote ſuperſtitious ends, yea ſome who never were? Do not their own Authors, ſuch as Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> queſtion the Popes Infallibility in Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſuppoſe he will not ſay all their Pope <hi>Leo</hi>'s and <hi>Gregori</hi>'s were Saints. I believe not <hi>Greg.</hi> the Second, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Hezekiah</hi> an Heretick for breaking of the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; nor <hi>Greg.</hi> 9. who tyrannized over <hi>Frederick</hi> the Second. Who may not paſs for a Saint among them, ſeeing <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. that Brand of Hell, has a place in their Calendar, why have they not added <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, who looked on the Goſpel as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to bear him company? As for <hi>Caeleſtin</hi>'s; was that Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Simplicity in <hi>Caelestine</hi> the Fifth, to be cheated by <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth out of the Popedom to an Hermitage?

fearing he might revoke that Sanctity, ſhut him up in Priſon, where he died for diſpleaſure that he had been fooled out of the Papacy.</p>
                        <p>But fourthly, <hi>He pitches on ſome real Saints, as</hi> Chryſoſtom, Ambroſe, Auſtin, <hi>and</hi> 36 <hi>ancient Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>that were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</hi> I grant theſe were Saints, but none of them Papiſts, more than the Prophets were Phariſees, though the Phariſees built their Tombs. Yea, nor was <hi>Bernard,</hi> though he lived in late and corrupt times, a Romaniſt of the late Edition; he did not approve the whole Syſteme of the now <hi>Tridentine</hi> Faith, though he eſcaped not altogether the Contagion of the times he lived in; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>he was indeed a Monk, and in many things ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, yet not a through-paced Papiſt, as is ſhewed by D. <hi>Francis White</hi> in defence of his Brother D. <hi>John White</hi> againſt <hi>T. W. P. Pap.</hi> 313, 314. and in particular, that he held the ſufficiency of the Scriptures without Traditions, Juſtification by Faith alone, that our works do not merit of condignity, that no man is able to keep the Law perfectly, that a juſt man may through mercy be aſſured of Grace, that there is no ſuch Free-will in fallen man as Jeſuits aſſert, and that he ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the pride of the Pope, and the Immaculate Conception of the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> To theſe, which D. <hi>John White</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from <hi>Bernards</hi> writings, D. <hi>Francis</hi> adds divers other points, as that he held the Euchariſt is to be a Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sacrifice, that he taught not Adoration of Images, that he believed Habitual Concupiſcence, to be a ſin, and that he maintained the Authority and Preheminence of the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and the ſubjection of the Apoſtles, and of all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks to his Juriſdiction.</p>
                        <p>This third and laſt Note of the Church, taken from Sanctity, might be inverted as the former hath been, not only from the Identity of our Religion with the Apoſtolick Religion, which is the only truly holy Religion, but alſo by appealing our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, to pitch upon one Article agreed on in the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Confeſſions, which hath not a tendency to Holineſs.

                  <p>The chief Cavils moved by Romaniſts againſt our Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, relate to the Call and Miſſion of our Reformers, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Paſtors, which though this Pamphleter hath not touched, yet ſeeing others lay ſo much ſtreſs upon them, and they may appear ſomewhat ſpecious to leſs diſcerning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I judged it might not be unfit briefly to reſolve the more important of them.</p>

                        </gap> Argument the nullity of the Call of our Reformers to be evicted, the nullity of ſucceeding Paſtors is alſo conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as deriving their Miſſion from the firſt Reformers, and ſo a</hi> non habentibus poteſtatem. <hi>Yea lastly, hence the nullity of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches is inferred, becauſe as</hi> Jerom contra Lucifer. <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces,</hi> Eccleſia non eſt quae non habet Sacerdotem, <hi>It can be no Church that hath no Miniſtry.</hi> I know no Sophiſm wherein Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts do more triumph, or the not penetrating the fallacy whereof, hath driven weak and leſs conſiderate Proteſtants up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more Precipices. This one Cavil is more ſpecious than all our Pamphleter ſaid: But I ſhall not decline to grapple with them, where their chief ſtrength doth lye.</p>
                  <p>In diſcovery therefore of the fallacy of this Sophiſm, I ſhall begin at the laſt and chief inference of the nullity of the Church, from the nullity of the Miniſtry, concerning which, I propoſe theſe two diſtinctions. Firſt, where there is no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, there is no Organical Church compleatly furniſhed with her Officers, it's granted; no Entitative Church, or no Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty profeſſing the Catholick Faith, it's denied<hi>:</hi> elſe when the Miniſters and Officers of a Church are removed by death, the Church ſhould periſh; but <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. it's ſaid, <hi>the Apoſtles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Elders in every Church;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, where it ſeems to be ſuppoſed they were Churches, for a time, without Paſtors; that is, they were Societies of viſible Profeſſors of the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt. But take this other diſtinction, there is no Catholick Church without a Miniſtry, it's granted: no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, is denied. It's true, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. there is a promiſe of perpetuity of a Miniſtry in the Catholick Church, for the edifying of the body; but it's no where promiſed that particular Churches ſhould never be deprived of their Paſtors for a time. And ſo though theſe Churches, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. for a time wanted Paſtors to take particular inſpection of them, yet even then there were Paſtors in the Catholick
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:150121:188"/>
Church, as the Apoſtles, and others; and this is all which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jerom</hi> in the place cited, or <hi>Cyprian Epiſt.</hi> 69. in a like te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony intended. From which I infer, though it were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which yet is ſplendidly falſe, that there were no lawful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in the Reformed Churches, yet the nullity of theſe Churches could not be concluded, but only a defect of need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Organs and Office-bearers, yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though there were neither Paſtors in Reformed Churches, nor in the Roman, yet would it not follow, that the Catholick Church had no Paſtors, for the Catholick Church extends it ſelf far beyond them both.</p>
                  <p>But in the next place I examine their firſt <hi>medium,</hi> and ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow all; it's a ſplendid falſhood, that the call of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers was null, for it had the Eſſentials requiſite to the call of Paſtors, conſequently ſucceeding Paſtors are ordained, <hi>ab habentibus poteſtatem;</hi> as to that <hi>Dilemma</hi> which hath been ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten canvaſed and confuted, I anſwer, <hi>the Call of Reformers was mediate and ordinary,</hi> and ſo needed not extraordinary Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials. They were not called to any new Function, or to preach any new truths; whereas ſome have ſaid their Call was extraordinary. It is to be underſtood only <hi>quoad modum, non quoad ſubſtantiam;</hi> or in regard of Heroick, and in ſome ſort, extraordinary endowments wherewith they were fitted for reviving collapſed truths, as is largely expounded by <hi>Voetius, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>deſper. cauſ. Pap. Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. and D. <hi>Prideaux de vocat. Miniſt.</hi> §. 7.</p>
                  <p>But it's urged, <hi>that then they have had their Miſſion from Ministers of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>whom many Protestants hold as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi> It's readily granted, and that without the leaſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Romiſh Intereſt, or detriment to the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>For ſatisfying thoſe that are judicious herein, let theſe few things be conſidered. And firſt, Though all Proteſtants be not agreed that the latter Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> are the grand Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, yet they who ſpeak moſt mildly in the thing, cannot but acknowledge that Romaniſts hold many Antichriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and that the ſpirit of Antichriſt hath long wrought in the chief Rulers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> both in regard of their Heretical Doctrines, eſpecially that of Papal Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then which not one can better ſerve the turn of Antichriſt, and of the exorbitant power uſurped by Popes, not only over
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:150121:188"/>
all Biſhops, but alſo over Kings, and whatſoever is called God. See of this D. <hi>Fern</hi> in his conſiderations of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Reformed, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. Secondly, according to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of both theſe (not only of them who hold the Pope to be a Petit Antichriſt, and a Fore-runner of the Great One, but alſo of them who affirm him to be the Grand Antichriſt) our Lord under the Papal Tyranny preſerved a Church in theſe Weſtern parts, and conſequently many great truths, ſuch as the Trinity, and Incarnation, and the ſubſtantials of many Ordinances, particularly of Baptiſm, and of Ordination, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit both of them were clogged with additional corruptions; yet in evidence that the Reformed Churches held their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and Ordination valid, they did not rebaptize, or reordain thoſe who had been baptized, or ordained by the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Neither need any think ſtrange at this, who remember that it's predicted of the Great Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>that he ſhall ſit in the Temple of God.</hi> From which it follows, that though Popes be the Great Antichriſt, yet Orders being one of theſe remains which God had preſerved under Antichriſts Uſurpation, Ordination conferred by Antichriſtian Miniſters (not in ſo far as Antichriſtian, but as retaining ſome of Chriſts goods) might be valid. Thirdly, I add, that in this the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs of God doth greatly appear, that under the prevalency of the Tyranny of the Papal Faction, he would preſerve a Church, and thereby tranſmit to Poſterity the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, which did luculently diſcover the corruptions of that Apoſtatized Church, and convey down orders to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who by vertue of their Ordination were authorized and obliged to endeavour the Reformation of the Church. Fourthly, that our Reformers did not ſet up a new Church, but did reform the old Apoſtatized Church; ſo that there needed no new Ordination, or immediate Call, but only faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to improve the power given them in their Ordination, to ſhake off, and witneſs againſt the corruptions of that lapſed Church. And fifthly and laſtly, this muſt be added, though Ordination was clogged with corruptions at the time when our Reformers received Ordination in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet was not Ordination in the Romiſh Church by far ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt as now it is, for then Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, his impious Oath, which he impoſed upon all perſons to be Ordained, was
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:150121:189"/>
not contrived. By all this, I hope, it may appear, that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers Ordination was valid, though received by Romiſh Miniſters, and yet the Romiſh Party not vindicated from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſm.</p>
                  <p>It's further objected, <hi>that Proteſtants look upon Romaniſts as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and conſequently ought to look upon Ordination from them as null. Anſw.</hi> That ſequel is null; Do not Romaniſts maintain, that Orders imprint an indeleble character on the Soul, which neither Schiſm nor Hereſie can extinguiſh, and that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conferred by Hereticks are valid, and particularly of this Sacrament of Orders? Jeſuit <hi>Connick Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>de Sacram. diſp.</hi> 20. <hi>dub.</hi> 9. <hi>Num.</hi> 84. concludes, <hi>Certum omnino eſt Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum Excommunicatum, Haereticum, &amp; degradatum, validè conferre or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines; i. e.</hi> It is altogether certain, that Orders conferred by a Biſhop Excommunicated, Heretical, and degraded, are valid. And though Proteſtants acknowledge no ſuch Sacramental cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter impreſſed on the Soul, yet they affirm that by Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a power is conferred, which is not utterly made void by every Schiſm or Hereſie; ſo that though Schiſmaticks, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, act irregularly in ordaining, yet Orders conferred by them are not null and void: Neither are they whom Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks or Hereticks ordain, bound in conſcience to propagate the Schiſm or Hereſies of thoſe who ordained them: yea, by relinquiſhing the Schiſm and Hereſies of their Ordainers, what irregularity was in their Ordination is ſupplied, and they come into a capacity of conferring Orders regularly, which their Ordainers abiding in Schiſm or Hereſie could not do. Hence it apparently follows, that though Romaniſts be both Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and Heretical, and act irregularly in conferring Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet the Orders conferred by them to our Reformers, were not only valid, but alſo the Reformers, by relinquiſhing the Heretical Doctrines, and Schiſmatical principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by owning the Catholick Truths oppugned by Romaniſts, had the defects and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of their Ordination ſupplied. Thus Romaniſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves anſwer concerning the Biſhops whom they own, who had been ordained by <hi>Cranmer</hi> in the time of Schiſm, as they call it, ſaying, they attained the regular uſe of their Orders by returning from Schiſm and Hereſie in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, when they were reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> they ought

That the Complex of their <hi>Trent</hi> Religion is latter than <hi>Luther,</hi> and that the truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church continued in all Ages, having both the Letter and ſenſe of holy Scripture, and Subſtantials of Faith main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſame Religion, which the Reformed Churches do to this day; conſequently the Reformed Churches are truly a part of that Catholick Church, from which Romaniſts do Schiſmatically ſeparate themſelves.

                  <p>THe vain Knacks where with he ſhuts up his Treatiſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 207, 208. are ſolidly confuted to my hand, by Learned and Judicious Mr. <hi>Rait</hi> in his Vindication of the Proteſtant Religion, <hi>pag.</hi> 268. for with the ſame froathy talk his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alſo had concluded his Scriblings; It ſhall be enough there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to me to make this Retorſion on Romaniſts.</p>
                  <p>They have Faith without Verity, Unity of Intereſt without Unity of Judgment, a Catholick Church without Catholiciſm, excluding the greateſt part of Chriſtendom, an Infallible Judge defining contradictions, and make the Divine Law a Noſe of Wax; a Church with many Heads, Altars, and Sacrifices, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Divine Inſtitution, a Propitiatory Sacrifice, without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood, yea, without a ſacrificing act, Image-worſhip, Bread-worſhip, Croſs-worſhip, Relick-worſhip, Saint-worſhip, (if they may be believed) without Idolatry, Sacraments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out viſible Elements, Sacraments ſo far from ſanctifying, that their moſt Religious perſons are obliged to vow abſtinence from them, Specters of accidents without a ſubject, they eat and devour their God, they have devotion without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, performing holy things in an unknown Language; they have Paſtors without Preaching, Communion without Communicants; they maintain a ſinleſs perfection, yet teach manifeſt violations of the Law of God; they cannot only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Heaven by their works, but alſo ſupererrogate, yet in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things they offend all; the Satisfaction of Chriſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, needs a ſupply of penal ſatisfactions, either in this life, or in Purgatory; the Efficacy of Grace depends on the beck of Free-will, and Eternal Election muſt be founded on the preſcience of mens good works, Popes have Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Function, but no immediate Miſſion, nor ſpeak they with Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they obtrude lying ſigns and wonders, yea, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Fables, for real Miracles, the Enthuſiaſms of their Popes for Divine Oracles, and bundles of Novelties under the Vizour of Antiquity; many Books they hold for Canonical Scripture, which neither the Jewiſh nor Primitive Chriſtian
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:150121:190"/>
Church did ever own. In a word, they ſet up a Religion built upon no Divine Authority, but upon Humane Traditions, and definitions of their Church, repugnant to Scripture, to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, to Reaſon, and to the ſenſes of all the world, teaching impious Idolatry againſt God, and perfidiouſneſs to men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving addition, or alteration, as the Grandees of the Romiſh Faction find moſt to conduce for the Grandeur of the Pope, and Intereſt of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But leſt I ſhould ſeem to ſay nothing to his Knacks, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer firſt, we have <hi>both Faith and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> Faith grounded on ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; and not only Unity in Fundamentals, which is neceſſary to the being of the Church Militant, but alſo in moſt of the Integrals of Religion, as may appear by the harmony of Confeſſions; whereas they have neither true Faith nor Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for hardly do they diſagree from us in any thing, wherein they are not ſubdivided among themſelves. Secondly, we have both a <hi>Law and a Judge,</hi> a Law better nor the Canon Law, the Divine Law of holy Scriptures, a Judge both Celeſtial, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and Terreſtrial, the Synods of the Church: But Romaniſts to ſhoulder up their pretended infallible Judge, whom yet they cannot agree upon, throw intollerable indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities upon the Law of God, as hath been demonſtrated <hi>cap.</hi> 3. Thirdly, <hi>we have an Altar and Sacrifices,</hi> an Altar not like their Altars of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> but an Altar which ſanctifies our Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And thus <hi>Aquinas</hi> himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>we have an Altar.</hi> We have alſo a Sacrifice, not only Euchariſtick of prayers and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but alſo certainly Propitiatory, <hi>viz.</hi> of Chriſt on the Croſs. Fourthly, our Sacraments are not bare ſigns, as Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts ſlander us, but exhibitive of Grace, which cannot be truly ſaid of all theirs. Fifthly, Though the Worſhip of God with us be not clogged, as in the Romiſh Church, with a heap of Ceremonies, partly Heatheniſh, partly Judaical, <hi>yet we have Religious Ceremonies, viz.</hi> Sacramental Rites, and theſe alſo of Divine Inſtitution. Sixthly, the Miſſion of our Preachers hath been ſuſtained againſt the cavils of Romaniſts, but a Divine Warrant cannot be ſhewed for their Popes Univerſal Vicarſhip, or the Princely Dignity of their Cardinals. Seventhly, <hi>Our Doctrine is infallible,</hi> and the ground of our Faith ſure, unleſs Romaniſts, like Infidels, will queſtion the Infallibility of the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:150121:191"/>
Scripture. Eighthly, Though we pretend not to a Phariſaical perfection with Romaniſts, <hi>yet we acknowledge the Commandments of God, ſo far as is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, through Grace, may be kept.</hi> Ninthly, Eternal Life being a reward of Grace, not of Debt, <hi>does not preſuppoſe any proper Merit of ours;</hi> but Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, by their Doctrine of Merit, make Heaven Venial, and derogate from the ſufficiency of the ſole Merits of Chriſt. Tenthly, Reprobation being an eternal and immanent Act of God, and conſequently God himſelf cannot properly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited, but there is no damnation without the previous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of ſin, yea, alſo the Eternal Decree of Reprobation, in the judgment of the Council of <hi>Dort,</hi> preſuppoſes the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Mans Fall. Eleventhly, <hi>though lapſed man, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating Grace, cannot do that which is ſpiritually good, yet be may freely ſin,</hi> none of us do queſtion; but the Jeſuits <hi>Garnet, Oldcorn, &amp;c.</hi> acted freely in their acceſſion to the Powder-Plot. Twelfth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>we pretend not to any new Apoſtles, nor is there neceſſity of new Miracles,</hi> our Doctrine having been fully confirmed by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles. Thirteenthly, It's more than Romaniſts can prove, <hi>that particular Churches have not Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to reform themſelves, when General Councils cannot be had to undertake the work.</hi> Fourteenthly, we leave <hi>private Spirits, and new Lights,</hi> againſt old revealed Verities, to Quakers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. Fifteenthly, <hi>Single mens Opinions againſt the common conſent of Fathers, have more affinity with Jeſuits Probables than Proteſtants.</hi> To juſtifie their boldneſs in broaching new Opinions, <hi>Poza</hi> the Jeſuit, as cited in the Jeſuits Morals, <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Art.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 167. brings a Teſtimony from a Council of <hi>Conſtantinople, Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus qui profert verbum inauditum;</hi> as if the Council had ſaid, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that produces a word unheard of, or ſome new thing; whereas like a Jeſuit, he mutilates and perverts the words of the Council, which are, <hi>Beatus qui profert verbum in auditum obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientium,</hi> bleſſed is he who utters a word to obedient ears. Sixteenthly, <hi>We are not aſhamed to maintain, that the Apocryphal Books are no part of the Old Teſtament,</hi> becauſe the Jewiſh Church did never receive them; being told, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>that to them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> Seventeenthly, there have been <hi>ſtedfaſt Paſtors and Martyrs in the Protestant Churches, who have ſealed the Truth we profeſs with their blood.</hi> Our Doctrine, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials of Government, being founded on Scriptural Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

If therefore the Religion of Proteſtants be known, mine cannot be uncertain: In that Faith was I Educated from my Infancy, and hitherto, thorough mercy, have continued, and therein I truſt to die. But who can be ſure of a Jeſuits Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? whoſe Principle it is to equivocate, and by the help of his Mental Reſervations to affirm and ſwear one thing, and to think another? What Sceptick and Infidel Gloſſes, which would make Chriſtian ears to tingle, Jeſuits have put upon the Apoſtolick Creed? <hi>Alphonſus de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>argas</hi> relates <hi>de Stratagem.

Book, and then, for fear of the French King, condemned it. Nor know I what Apology can be made for any of theſe, unleſs it be ſaid, <hi>Mutarunt linguam, non mentem,</hi> that they changed their Tongue, but not their Mind; which leaves no leſs ſtain upon their ingenuity, than the change of their mind would have done upon their Intellectuals. Here I muſt advertiſe the Pamphleter, that he and his Fellows diſcover either ignorance or malice, when they upbraid Proteſtants with their Diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary differences, as if they made different Religions. If theſe of the Epiſcopal perſwaſion reſolved their Faith on the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Authority, as Jeſuits do on the Popes; or if Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans reſolved their Faith on the Authority of the Claſſis, as the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enetian</hi> Papiſts do on the General Council, they would indeed make different Religions, as Papiſts certainly have different Religions, notwithſtanding their vain preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Infallibility and Unity: But the Faith of all Proteſtants, under theſe various denominations, is reſolved upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God ſpeaking in the Scriptures; and beſides, they do agree in Dogmaticals, and ſo cannot make different Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. I heartily wiſh there were more Pacificatories written, and more pains taken for accommodating our Diſciplinary Controverſies; that all ſound Proteſtants might unanimouſly concur againſt Jeſuits, and the common Adverſaries of the truly Catholick Faith. I deteſt Schiſms, however I be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by Jeſuits, remembring that of <hi>Cyprian de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nit. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.

            <p>THe Author living in another Kingdom, and not being able to reviſe the Preſs, and the Copy which came<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hither having been written by a young Scholar not ſo correctly as might have been wiſhed, many errors have crept into the work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſome of which do greatly wreſt the ſenſe, yea ſometimes do deſtroy it. May it therefore pleaſe the ſerious Reader, when any thing occurrs which ſeems incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, to turn over to the Errata, where readily he may find that cleared, which in the work appeared intricate, or perhaps abſurd. As for inſtance <hi>p.</hi> 318. <hi>l.</hi> 2. It may juſtly ſeem ſtrange, that the epithet Saint is prefixed to <hi>Ambroſe Catharinus</hi> a moderne Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, as if he had been the ancient, S. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> B. of Millan; whereas by looking on the Errata, where. <hi>S.</hi> is appointed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged, the Reader may underſtand that the Epithet Saint was not in the Authors Copy. By the ſame means diverſe other miſtaks of the impreſſion may be cleared, eſpecially ſeeing it is hoped, that theſe which are not ſet down may eaſily be obſerved by the judicious Reader. It is likewiſe granted, that many treſpaſſes are committed in the puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but there was neceſſity to leave theſe to the Correction of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Reader. Where the Printer found in the Coppy this figure. § he ordinarily hath printed Sect. and ſo hath ſometimes put twice Sect. in one place. Some of thoſe eſcapes are noted amongſt the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata, that by them the Reader might eaſily paſs judgment on the reſt. And if he would be at pains to correct the errours with his pen, he would oblige the Author, and eaſe thoſe of trouble, who afterwards ſhould make uſe of his book, If either Jeſuit, or other Reader im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute any of theſe, or ſuch like eſcapes unto the Author, he will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more prejudice againſt the cauſe, or perſon of the Author, than either judgment or diſcretion. However the Errata is ſubjoyned for the uſe of ingenuous lovers of truth.</p>
            <p>It is to be noted, that whereas <hi>cap. 3. Sect. 3. page 94. Lyranus, Paulus Burgenſis, Valla &amp; Cajetan</hi> are joyned with <hi>Eraſmus, Pagnin, Arias Montanus &amp;c.</hi> the meaning is not, that the firſt four Authors had tranſlated entire books of Scripture, as the latter had done, but that thoſe alſo in their Expoſitions of Scripture, did frequently recede from the Vulgar Latin, and corrected it.</p>
            <p>Likwiſe, where as it is ſaid <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>pag</hi> 95. <hi>that Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts can only object againſt our tranſlations of Scripture ſome</hi>

               </hi> that is to be underſtood of <hi>Caſtalio, Broughton, Carolus Molinaeus, and others</hi> of that quality cited by the Pamphleter. But there a touch ſhould have been given how the Pampheter had abuſed an expreſſion of King James in the conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> viz. that the <hi>Geneva</hi> tranſlation is the worſt of all Engliſh tranſlations. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the King the Pamphleter abuſes to impugne the Scriptures, being the rule of Faith, which his Majeſty never intended, nor was his meaning that the <hi>Geneva</hi> tranſlation compoſed, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1560. By the Engliſh Exiles, who fled thither in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or that the other Engliſh tranſlations, the faillours whereof were likewiſe briefly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hinted at by the King, did not contain all things neceſſary to Salvation. Yea the particular treſpaſes noted by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in the <hi>Geneva</hi> bible were in the Marginal annotations, not in the tranſlation it ſelf. Thereal deſign of the King was to hold forth, that no Engliſh tranſlation then extant had arrived at the perfection, which were not only to be wiſhed, but alſo by more induſtry might be attained, whereupon his Majeſty gave ſpecial order to compoſe the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tranſlation, which we now by the mercy of God do enjoy. It were good that Romaniſts had as much ingenuity to acknowledge the errors of their vulgar latin, as laſtly corrected by <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, a ſpecimen whereof hath been exhihited by <hi>Franciſus Lucas Brugen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any be not ſatisfied with the touch given of the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tib, pag.</hi> 102. 103. they are remitted to <hi>Sixtinus Amama</hi> his diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>de Keri &amp; Chetib in coronide ad Grammaticam Martinio Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torfianam.</hi> where though that learned Author ſeem to make large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions concerning the <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Chetib,</hi> and the various lecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet neither do they overthrow the doctrine of the reformed Church concerning Scriptures being the rule of faith, as <hi>Amama</hi> himſelf in the Anſwer of ſome objections endeavours to clear.</p>
            <p>It is alſo to be noted that whereas in <hi>page</hi> 472. <hi>Clements Epiſt.</hi> 1. is pronounced ſpurious. The Authors deſigne was not to cenſure <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians</hi> lately publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Patrick Young,</hi> which <hi>Rivet Crit. ſac. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.
